Docker setup and project infrastructure improvements

This commit includes several significant improvements to the project infrastructure:

1. Docker Environment Setup:
   - Created docker-compose.dev.yml for complete development environment with backend, frontend, PostgreSQL, and Redis
   - Created docker-compose.simple.yml for lightweight DB and Redis setup only
   - Added Dockerfile.backend.dev for Python backend containerization
   - Added Dockerfile.frontend.dev for React frontend containerization
   - Successfully configured and tested containers (db and redis services running)
   - Fixed Docker configuration issues and documentation

2. Authentication System:
   - Added auth.py with full JWT authentication implementation
   - Implemented password hashing and verification with bcrypt
   - Created TokenData and Token Pydantic models
   - Added OAuth2 password bearer scheme
   - Implemented role-based access control with get_current_user and get_current_active_user dependencies
   - Added token generation and validation with proper expiration

3. Database Utilities:
   - Added database.py with SQLAlchemy async session management
   - Implemented AsyncSession factory
   - Created get_db dependency for FastAPI endpoints
   - Set up proper connection pooling for PostgreSQL
   - Configured environment variable handling for database connection

4. Judge Analysis Improvements:
   - Enhanced analyze_judges.py to store analysis results in the database
   - Added store_judge_analytics function for storing analysis in the database
   - Added store_judge_pattern function for storing judge patterns
   - Implemented analysis of writing style, topics, and ruling patterns
   - Added questioning pattern analysis from oral arguments
   - Added command line interface for analyzing specific judges or all judges

5. User Management:
   - Added create_user.py script for user creation and management
   - Implemented admin user creation functionality
   - Added interactive mode for admin creation
   - Added list_users functionality to view existing users
   - Added command-line argument parsing for different operations

6. Frontend Scaffolding:
   - Set up basic React application structure
   - Added package.json with dependencies (React, React Router, Axios, Recharts, Tailwind CSS)
   - Created basic React components (App, index, etc.)
   - Added public HTML template
   - Set up proper directory structure

7. Project Dependencies:
   - Added comprehensive requirements.txt with all Python dependencies
   - Included FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PyTorch, spaCy, scikit-learn, and other ML libraries
   - Added authentication libraries (python-jose, passlib)
   - Added database drivers and ORM tools
   - Added testing and development utilities

8. Updated TODO List:
   - Marked completed tasks in TODO.md including Docker setup, authentication, and judge analytics storage
   - Updated infrastructure items to reflect progress
   - Updated project roadmap based on completed work

This commit represents a major step forward in the project's infrastructure, making it possible to run database services in Docker while enabling local development of the backend and frontend components. The development environment is now properly configured and ready for further implementation of the Litigation Simulator features.
