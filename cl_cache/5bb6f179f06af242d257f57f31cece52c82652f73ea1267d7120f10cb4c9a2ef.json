State File No.    860454-2024\n\nAqua-Chem, Inc., et al\n\n\nAppeal from the Court of Workers\u2019\nCompensation Claims\nLisa A. Lowe, Judge\n\n                                 Affirmed and Remanded\n\nIn this interlocutory appeal, the employee challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion\nto compel. The employee alleged he contracted several diseases, including metastatic\ncancer and toxic encephalopathy, as a result of occupational exposures over the course of\nhis employment with the employer. The employer obtained an opinion from a doctor\nspecializing in oncology and hematology regarding causation who initially determined the\nemployee\u2019s conditions were more likely than not caused by occupational exposures.\nHowever, once the employer provided additional information to its expert regarding the\nemployee\u2019s medical history and conditions at the employer\u2019s facility, she revised her\ncausation opinion. After the employer declined to allow the employee to enter its facility\nto obtain video and photographs of conditions inside the plant, the employee filed a motion\nto compel. The employer objected to the employee\u2019s request on the grounds of relevance\nand confidentiality, stating that it could not grant such access to the facility because of its\nobligations to its customers, including the United States military, and any video and\nphotographs obtained would not be relevant because the employee had not worked at the\nfacility in ten years. The trial court denied the motion to compel, and the employee has\nappealed. Having carefully reviewed the record, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order and\nremand the case.\n\nJudge Meredith B. Weaver delivered the opinion of the Appeals Board in which Presiding\nJudge Timothy W. Conner and Judge Pele I. Godkin joined.\n\nDavid H. Dunaway, Alcoa, Tennessee, for the employee-appellant, George Patrick Lawson\n\nOwen R. Lipscomb, London, Kentucky, for the employer-appellee, Aqua-Chem, Inc.\n\n\n                                              1\n\f                          Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       George Patrick Lawson (\u201cEmployee\u201d) began working for Aqua-Chem, Inc.\n(\u201cEmployer\u201d), in 1993 as a machinist. In that position, Employee was required to operate\ncertain equipment and handle and process metal components in an industrial setting. In\n2014, Employee became a project engineer, which required reviewing drawings and\ncoordinating project plans with stakeholders, primarily in an office environment.\nEmployee then left Employer and began working in sales with another company in 2016,\nwhere he remained until 2024.\n\n       In September 2024, Employee was diagnosed with prostate cancer that had\nmetastasized to his ribs. On December 2, 2024, following a medical evaluation requested\nby his attorney, Employee was informed by Dr. C.M. Salekin that he believed Employee\u2019s\nprostate cancer was caused by occupational exposure to hexavalent chromium and other\ncarcinogens while working for Employer. Dr. Salekin also diagnosed Employee with toxic\nencephalopathy caused by exposure to \u201ccutting oil\u201d ingredients during his employment\nwith Employer. Employee filed a petition for benefit determination the following day,\nalleging he suffered from prostate cancer, bone cancer, and toxic encephalopathy caused\nby \u201cexposure to stainless steel, other metal cuttings, cutting fluids, lubricants, and welding\nfumes during the course and scope of [his] employment.\u201d Employee included with his\npetition a Standard Form Medical Report (Form C-32) completed by Dr. Salekin.\nEmployee later voluntarily dismissed his initial petition and filed another petition on March\n12, 2025, adding \u201cemotional injuries\u201d as a claim. Employee requested an expedited\nhearing in May, seeking a decision on the record, and Employer objected, requesting\nadditional time and an in-person evidentiary hearing. The trial court issued an order on\nJune 25, 2025, denying Employer\u2019s request for an in-person hearing and stating it would\nmake a decision on the record due to the \u201cextraordinary circumstances involving\n[Employee\u2019s] health.\u201d It ordered Employee to provide any supplemental information it\nwanted the court to consider by July 10 and for Employer to provide any such supplemental\ninformation by July 25.\n\n       On July 7, Employee filed a motion to \u201ccompel entry, video and photography of the\npremises.\u201d Employer objected and, in the alternative, requested a protective order. The\nparties then proceeded to comply with the previously set deadlines in preparation for the\ntrial court\u2019s on-the-record determination. Employer filed a portion of Employee\u2019s\ndeposition as part of the record, and, after his deadline for submission had passed,\nEmployee moved the court for the opportunity to supplement the record with his complete\ndeposition. Employer filed a motion for a thirty-day extension to submit additional records,\narguing that if Employee was allowed to supplement the record, it should have the same\nopportunity. The trial court agreed and granted a thirty-day extension until August 14 to\nsubmit any other materials, and until August 21 to submit the briefs and any evidentiary\nobjections.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f        Before the court completed its on-the-record determination, Employee filed a\nmotion for summary judgment, as well as some additional medical records. 1 Employer\nfiled the opinion of Dr. Judy L. Schmidt on August 14, 2025, which included a document\ndated July 15, 2025, entitled \u201cPeer Review\u201d and an August 11, 2025 addendum. Dr.\nSchmidt had initially opined that Employee\u2019s \u201ccognitive impairment and prostate cancer\nare occupationally related\u201d to his employment with Employer. However, Employer\nprovided her with an OSHA facts sheet on hexavalent chromium; information regarding\nair quality testing of its facility from 2024 and 2025; information regarding the existence\nof exhaust fans at its facility; and information regarding Employee\u2019s medical history,\nincluding an alleged history of smoking. Dr. Schmidt revised her opinion, stating that,\n\u201c[b]ased on the totality of the evidence, I consider that the causal link between the\nclaimant\u2019s metastatic prostate cancer and his occupational exposure is speculative . . . .\u201d\nEmployee promptly objected and filed a renewed motion to compel entry to Employer\u2019s\npremises for purposes of obtaining video and photographs of the plant. Employer renewed\nits objections and its motion for a protective order.\n\n       On September 12, 2025, the trial court denied Employee\u2019s motion to compel, stating\nthat Employer \u201chas raised valid security and relevancy concerns\u201d and finding that \u201cvideos\nand photographs of [Employer\u2019s] plant in 2025 are not relevant or instructive of the plant\nset-up in 2015.\u201d The trial court went on to observe that Employee could cross-examine\nDr. Schmidt about the additional information she had reviewed during her deposition.\nEmployee has appealed. 2\n\n                                        Standard of Review\n\n       The standard we apply in reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision presumes that the court\u2019s\nfactual findings are correct unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise. See\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 50-6-239(c)(7) (2024). The interpretation and application of statutes\nand regulations are questions of law that are reviewed de novo with no presumption of\ncorrectness afforded the trial court\u2019s conclusions. See Mansell v. Bridgestone Firestone N.\nAm. Tire, LLC, 417 S.W.3d 393, 399 (Tenn. 2013). However, a trial court\u2019s decision to\ngrant or deny a discovery motion is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.\nJohnson v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., 146 S.W.3d 600, 604 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004). This standard\n\u201ccontemplates that before a reversal the record must show that a judge \u2018applied an incorrect\n\n1\n Although titled a motion for summary judgment, Employee\u2019s motion sought partial summary judgment\nas to the issue of the compensability of Employee\u2019s claims. To date, that motion remains pending.\n2\n  Employee filed a purported statement of the evidence on appeal. However, it is not a proper statement of\nthe evidence, as the order being appealed was issued based on a review of the record and without an\nevidentiary hearing. See Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0800-02-22-.05(1) (2023) (\u201c[A]ny appealing party may\n\u201cprepare a statement of the evidence summarizing the live witness testimony presented at the hearing.\u201d\nAccordingly, we decline to consider the purported statement of the evidence. Furthermore, Employee\nrequested oral argument on appeal, and that request is denied.\n                                                    3\n\flegal standard, or reached a decision which is against logic or reasoning that caused an\ninjustice to the party complaining.\u2019\u201d Hubbard v. Sherman-Dixie Concrete Indus., No.\nE2010-02219-WC-R3-WC, 2011 Tenn. LEXIS 965, at *11 (Tenn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Panel\nOct. 18, 2011) (quoting State v. Farrell, 277 S.W.3d 372, 378 (Tenn. 2009)). We are also\nmindful of our obligation to construe the workers\u2019 compensation statutes \u201cfairly,\nimpartially, and in accordance with basic principles of statutory construction\u201d and in a way\nthat does not favor either the employee or the employer. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 50-6-116\n(2024).\n\n                                                Analysis\n\n        Employee identified two issues on his notice of appeal, which we restate as follows:\n(1) whether the trial court erred in denying his motion to obtain video and photographs of\nEmployer\u2019s facility; and (2) whether the court erred in denying Employee\u2019s motion to strike\nthe addendum of Dr. Schmidt. In his brief on appeal, Employee concedes that, although\nthe denial of the motion to strike the addendum is listed as an issue, the trial court has not\nyet ruled on that motion. As such, the only issue for purposes of this appeal is whether the\ntrial court abused its discretion in denying Employee\u2019s motion to compel. 3 For the reasons\nstated below, we conclude it did not.\n\n        It is well-settled that discovery in Tennessee is generally broad, and the rules\ngoverning discovery are to be liberally construed. Estate of Guinn v. Barnard Roofing\nCompany, Inc., No. 2017-02-0207, 2017 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 59, at *6-7\n(Tenn. Workers\u2019 Comp. App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2017). In circumstances where a litigant objects\nto a discovery request, the party seeking the discovery must present evidence in support of\na motion to compel sufficient to show \u201cgood cause\u201d as to why a court order is necessary.\nId. at *13. Here, Employee seeks to compel Employer to allow him to enter Employer\u2019s\npremises to obtain video and photographs of all or parts of the plant. Citing Rule 34.01 of\nthe Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, Employee argues that inspection of the premises\nand obtaining video and photographs of Employee\u2019s workstation are necessary to prevent\n\u201csubstantial unfairness\u201d to Employee and to prevent Employer from \u201cmanipulating\u201d\nevidence. In response, Employer argues that the relevance and probative value of any such\nphotographic evidence would be minimal given that Employee has not worked at the plant\nin ten years, and it must abide by certain confidentiality restrictions required by its\ncustomers, including the United States military.\n\n\n3\n  Employee also contends in his brief that the trial\u2019s court\u2019s denial of the motion to compel is tantamount\nto granting Employer\u2019s motion for a protective order. However, there is no order granting that motion in\nthe record. Furthermore, Employer\u2019s request for a protective order was conditioned on the trial court\ngranting Employee\u2019s motion to compel, which it did not do. On appeal, we cannot review this issue without\na trial court order addressing the motion for protective order. Keyes v. Bridgestone Americas, No. 2016-\n06-2007, 2017 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 33, at *7-8 (Tenn. Workers\u2019 Comp. App. Bd. May 18,\n2017).\n                                                    4\n\f        Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 34.01 allows any party to request \u201centry upon\ndesignated land or other property . . . for the purpose of inspection . . . within the scope of\nRule 26.02.\u201d Rule 26 requires discovery to be relevant to the subject matter of the action\nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It specifically\nstates that a court has discretion to limit discovery depending on a variety of factors,\nincluding \u201cthe needs of the case, the amount in controversy, . . . and the importance of the\nissues at stake in the litigation.\u201d As we recently noted, the Tennessee Supreme Court has\nestablished \u201ca balancing test that a trial court must use when assessing disputed discovery\nrequests,\u201d stating that \u201ceven if the requested information is not privileged and is relevant\nto an issue in the case, the trial court should still \u201cbalance the specific need for the\ninformation against the harm that could result from disclosure.\u201d See Anderson v. U.S.\nFoods, Inc., No. 2025-80-0906, 2025 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 48, at *12-13\n(Tenn. Workers\u2019 Comp. App. Bd. Sept. 25, 2025) (citing West v. Schofield, 460 S.W.3d\n113, 127-28 (Tenn. 2015)).\n\n      Furthermore, we are required to review a trial court\u2019s discretionary decision to deny\nthe motion to compel discovery by determining\n\n       (1) whether the factual basis for the decision is properly supported by the\n       evidence in the record, (2) whether the [trial] court properly identified and\n       applied the most appropriate legal principles applicable to the decision, and\n       (3) whether the [trial] court\u2019s decision was within the range of acceptable\n       alternative dispositions.\n\nLee Med., Inc. v. Beecher, 312 S.W.3d 515, 524-25 (Tenn. 2010) (internal citations\nomitted).\n\n       Here, Employer argued that the requested information was, in fact, privileged and/or\nsubject to confidentiality requirements due to its obligations as reflected in military\ncontracts and nondisclosure agreements with other clients. Employer also provided a Rule\n72 Declaration of its Vice President of Quality and Supply Chain, stating that it was\nrequired to protect \u201ccontrolled unclassified information\u201d due to its working relationship\nwith the United States military. Employee provided no evidence calling into question these\ncontractual obligations, but, seeming to presume his workstation is in the condition it was\nwhen he left the plant in 2015, argued that Employee\u2019s workstation is not part of the plant\nto which those contractual obligations apply. In addition, Employee asserts that video and\nphotographs of Employee\u2019s former workstation are the best evidence for Employer\u2019s\nexpert, Dr. Schmidt, to review in formulating her causation opinions. However, Employee\nprovided no evidence to support his assertion that his former workstation is outside a\nprotected area, particularly in consideration of how much time has passed since his\nemployment ended.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f        Furthermore, we conclude the court properly examined the relevance of the\nrequested information. Employee ceased working for Employer approximately ten years\nbefore being diagnosed with prostate cancer. The court noted that, even if certain of the\nfacility\u2019s operations were not subject to confidentiality obligations, pictures and videos of\nthe facility\u2019s current state would provide little or no relevant evidence regarding the\nconditions of the facility as it existed at the time Employee left in 2015.\n\n       We note that the court\u2019s interlocutory decision to deny the motion to compel does\nnot impact in any way Employee\u2019s ability to question witnesses regarding the layout or\nconditions of the facility at the time of his employment. The parties have already deposed\nfour co-workers of Employee, and counsel has had the opportunity to ask for their\nrecollections of Employee\u2019s workstation and the presence, absence, or location of exhaust\nfans relative to that workstation. Employer has provided Employee with a diagram of the\nplant and pictures of exhaust fans in the facility. In addition, as noted by the trial court,\nEmployee will have the opportunity to cross-examine Employer\u2019s expert and can question\nher regarding any information she reviewed and whether her opinions would be impacted\nby additional information regarding the layout or conditions of the plant. Finally,\nEmployee is not precluded from requesting Employer to provide additional photographs or\nvideo of specific areas of the plant that would not require Employer to violate its\nconfidentiality requirements or contractual obligations. In short, we conclude the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by denying Employee\u2019s motion to compel at this\ninterlocutory stage of the case.\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order and remand the case.\nCosts on appeal are taxed to Employee.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f                    TENNESSEE BUREAU OF WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION\n                      WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD\n\nGeorge Patrick Lawson                                        Docket No. 2025-30-2913\n\nv.

Lowe, Judge\n\n                                 Affirmed and Remanded\n\nIn this interlocutory appeal, the employee challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion\nto compel. The employee alleged he contracted several diseases, including metastatic\ncancer and toxic encephalopathy, as a result of occupational exposures over the course of\nhis employment with the employer. The employer obtained an opinion from a doctor\nspecializing in oncology and hematology regarding causation who initially determined the\nemployee\u2019s conditions were more likely than not caused by occupational exposures.\nHowever, once the employer provided additional information to its expert regarding the\nemployee\u2019s medical history and conditions at the employer\u2019s facility, she revised her\ncausation opinion. After the employer declined to allow the employee to enter its facility\nto obtain video and photographs of conditions inside the plant, the employee filed a motion\nto compel. The employer objected to the employee\u2019s request on the grounds of relevance\nand confidentiality, stating that it could not grant such access to the facility because of its\nobligations to its customers, including the United States military, and any video and\nphotographs obtained would not be relevant because the employee had not worked at the\nfacility in ten years. The trial court denied the motion to compel, and the employee has\nappealed. Having carefully reviewed the record, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order and\nremand the case.\n\nJudge Meredith B. Weaver delivered the opinion of the Appeals Board in which Presiding\nJudge Timothy W. Conner and Judge Pele I. Godkin joined.\n\nDavid H. Dunaway, Alcoa, Tennessee, for the employee-appellant, George Patrick Lawson\n\nOwen R. Lipscomb, London, Kentucky, for the employer-appellee, Aqua-Chem, Inc.\n\n\n                                              1\n\f                          Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       George Patrick Lawson (\u201cEmployee\u201d) began working for Aqua-Chem, Inc.\n(\u201cEmployer\u201d), in 1993 as a machinist. In that position, Employee was required to operate\ncertain equipment and handle and process metal components in an industrial setting. In\n2014, Employee became a project engineer, which required reviewing drawings and\ncoordinating project plans with stakeholders, primarily in an office environment.\nEmployee then left Employer and began working in sales with another company in 2016,\nwhere he remained until 2024.\n\n       In September 2024, Employee was diagnosed with prostate cancer that had\nmetastasized to his ribs. On December 2, 2024, following a medical evaluation requested\nby his attorney, Employee was informed by Dr. C.M. Salekin that he believed Employee\u2019s\nprostate cancer was caused by occupational exposure to hexavalent chromium and other\ncarcinogens while working for Employer. Dr. Salekin also diagnosed Employee with toxic\nencephalopathy caused by exposure to \u201ccutting oil\u201d ingredients during his employment\nwith Employer. Employee filed a petition for benefit determination the following day,\nalleging he suffered from prostate cancer, bone cancer, and toxic encephalopathy caused\nby \u201cexposure to stainless steel, other metal cuttings, cutting fluids, lubricants, and welding\nfumes during the course and scope of [his] employment.\u201d Employee included with his\npetition a Standard Form Medical Report (Form C-32) completed by Dr. Salekin.\nEmployee later voluntarily dismissed his initial petition and filed another petition on March\n12, 2025, adding \u201cemotional injuries\u201d as a claim. Employee requested an expedited\nhearing in May, seeking a decision on the record, and Employer objected, requesting\nadditional time and an in-person evidentiary hearing. The trial court issued an order on\nJune 25, 2025, denying Employer\u2019s request for an in-person hearing and stating it would\nmake a decision on the record due to the \u201cextraordinary circumstances involving\n[Employee\u2019s] health.\u201d It ordered Employee to provide any supplemental information it\nwanted the court to consider by July 10 and for Employer to provide any such supplemental\ninformation by July 25.\n\n       On July 7, Employee filed a motion to \u201ccompel entry, video and photography of the\npremises.\u201d Employer objected and, in the alternative, requested a protective order. The\nparties then proceeded to comply with the previously set deadlines in preparation for the\ntrial court\u2019s on-the-record determination. Employer filed a portion of Employee\u2019s\ndeposition as part of the record, and, after his deadline for submission had passed,\nEmployee moved the court for the opportunity to supplement the record with his complete\ndeposition. Employer filed a motion for a thirty-day extension to submit additional records,\narguing that if Employee was allowed to supplement the record, it should have the same\nopportunity. The trial court agreed and granted a thirty-day extension until August 14 to\nsubmit any other materials, and until August 21 to submit the briefs and any evidentiary\nobjections.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f        Before the court completed its on-the-record determination, Employee filed a\nmotion for summary judgment, as well as some additional medical records. 1 Employer\nfiled the opinion of Dr. Judy L. Schmidt on August 14, 2025, which included a document\ndated July 15, 2025, entitled \u201cPeer Review\u201d and an August 11, 2025 addendum. Dr.\nSchmidt had initially opined that Employee\u2019s \u201ccognitive impairment and prostate cancer\nare occupationally related\u201d to his employment with Employer. However, Employer\nprovided her with an OSHA facts sheet on hexavalent chromium; information regarding\nair quality testing of its facility from 2024 and 2025; information regarding the existence\nof exhaust fans at its facility; and information regarding Employee\u2019s medical history,\nincluding an alleged history of smoking. Dr. Schmidt revised her opinion, stating that,\n\u201c[b]ased on the totality of the evidence, I consider that the causal link between the\nclaimant\u2019s metastatic prostate cancer and his occupational exposure is speculative . . . .\u201d\nEmployee promptly objected and filed a renewed motion to compel entry to Employer\u2019s\npremises for purposes of obtaining video and photographs of the plant. Employer renewed\nits objections and its motion for a protective order.\n\n       On September 12, 2025, the trial court denied Employee\u2019s motion to compel, stating\nthat Employer \u201chas raised valid security and relevancy concerns\u201d and finding that \u201cvideos\nand photographs of [Employer\u2019s] plant in 2025 are not relevant or instructive of the plant\nset-up in 2015.\u201d The trial court went on to observe that Employee could cross-examine\nDr. Schmidt about the additional information she had reviewed during her deposition.\nEmployee has appealed. 2\n\n                                        Standard of Review\n\n       The standard we apply in reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision presumes that the court\u2019s\nfactual findings are correct unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise.

In his brief on appeal, Employee concedes that, although\nthe denial of the motion to strike the addendum is listed as an issue, the trial court has not\nyet ruled on that motion. As such, the only issue for purposes of this appeal is whether the\ntrial court abused its discretion in denying Employee\u2019s motion to compel. 3 For the reasons\nstated below, we conclude it did not.\n\n        It is well-settled that discovery in Tennessee is generally broad, and the rules\ngoverning discovery are to be liberally construed. Estate of Guinn v. Barnard Roofing\nCompany, Inc., No. 2017-02-0207, 2017 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 59, at *6-7\n(Tenn. Workers\u2019 Comp. App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2017). In circumstances where a litigant objects\nto a discovery request, the party seeking the discovery must present evidence in support of\na motion to compel sufficient to show \u201cgood cause\u201d as to why a court order is necessary.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at *13</span><pre class=\"inline\">. Here, Employee seeks to compel Employer to allow him to enter Employer\u2019s\npremises to obtain video and photographs of all or parts of the plant. Citing Rule 34.01 of\nthe Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, Employee argues that inspection of the premises\nand obtaining video and photographs of Employee\u2019s workstation are necessary to prevent\n\u201csubstantial unfairness\u201d to Employee and to prevent Employer from \u201cmanipulating\u201d\nevidence. In response, Employer argues that the relevance and probative value of any such\nphotographic evidence would be minimal given that Employee has not worked at the plant\nin ten years, and it must abide by certain confidentiality restrictions required by its\ncustomers, including the United States military.\n\n\n3\n  Employee also contends in his brief that the trial\u2019s court\u2019s denial of the motion to compel is tantamount\nto granting Employer\u2019s motion for a protective order. However, there is no order granting that motion in\nthe record. Furthermore, Employer\u2019s request for a protective order was conditioned on the trial court\ngranting Employee\u2019s motion to compel, which it did not do. On appeal, we cannot review this issue without\na trial court order addressing the motion for protective order. Keyes v. Bridgestone Americas, No. 2016-\n06-2007, 2017 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd.

It specifically\nstates that a court has discretion to limit discovery depending on a variety of factors,\nincluding \u201cthe needs of the case, the amount in controversy, . . . and the importance of the\nissues at stake in the litigation.\u201d As we recently noted, the Tennessee Supreme Court has\nestablished \u201ca balancing test that a trial court must use when assessing disputed discovery\nrequests,\u201d stating that \u201ceven if the requested information is not privileged and is relevant\nto an issue in the case, the trial court should still \u201cbalance the specific need for the\ninformation against the harm that could result from disclosure.\u201d See Anderson v.

Paula Beecher\">312 S.W.3d 515, 524-25</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 2010) (internal citations\nomitted).\n\n       Here, Employer argued that the requested information was, in fact, privileged and/or\nsubject to confidentiality requirements due to its obligations as reflected in military\ncontracts and nondisclosure agreements with other clients. Employer also provided a Rule\n72 Declaration of its Vice President of Quality and Supply Chain, stating that it was\nrequired to protect \u201ccontrolled unclassified information\u201d due to its working relationship\nwith the United States military. Employee provided no evidence calling into question these\ncontractual obligations, but, seeming to presume his workstation is in the condition it was\nwhen he left the plant in 2015, argued that Employee\u2019s workstation is not part of the plant\nto which those contractual obligations apply. In addition, Employee asserts that video and\nphotographs of Employee\u2019s former workstation are the best evidence for Employer\u2019s\nexpert, Dr. Schmidt, to review in formulating her causation opinions. However, Employee\nprovided no evidence to support his assertion that his former workstation is outside a\nprotected area, particularly in consideration of how much time has passed since his\nemployment ended.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f        Furthermore, we conclude the court properly examined the relevance of the\nrequested information. Employee ceased working for Employer approximately ten years\nbefore being diagnosed with prostate cancer. The court noted that, even if certain of the\nfacility\u2019s operations were not subject to confidentiality obligations, pictures and videos of\nthe facility\u2019s current state would provide little or no relevant evidence regarding the\nconditions of the facility as it existed at the time Employee left in 2015.\n\n       We note that the court\u2019s interlocutory decision to deny the motion to compel does\nnot impact in any way Employee\u2019s ability to question witnesses regarding the layout or\nconditions of the facility at the time of his employment. The parties have already deposed\nfour co-workers of Employee, and counsel has had the opportunity to ask for their\nrecollections of Employee\u2019s workstation and the presence, absence, or location of exhaust\nfans relative to that workstation. Employer has provided Employee with a diagram of the\nplant and pictures of exhaust fans in the facility. In addition, as noted by the trial court,\nEmployee will have the opportunity to cross-examine Employer\u2019s expert and can question\nher regarding any information she reviewed and whether her opinions would be impacted\nby additional information regarding the layout or conditions of the plant. Finally,\nEmployee is not precluded from requesting Employer to provide additional photographs or\nvideo of specific areas of the plant that would not require Employer to violate its\nconfidentiality requirements or contractual obligations. In short, we conclude the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by denying Employee\u2019s motion to compel at this\ninterlocutory stage of the case.\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order and remand the case.\nCosts on appeal are taxed to Employee.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f                    TENNESSEE BUREAU OF WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION\n                      WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD\n\nGeorge Patrick Lawson                                        Docket No. 2025-30-2913\n\nv.

SIMPSON, Attorney for Appellant\nROBERT C. LOGSDON, Attorney for Appellee\n\n\nEPLEY, P.J.\n\n       {\u00b6 1} Mother appeals from the judgment of the Clark County Common Pleas Court,\n\nDomestic Relations Division, Juvenile Section, granting permanent custody of three of her\n\nchildren, Z.A.1, Z.A.2, and A.A., to the Clark County Department of Job and Family Services\n\n(\u201cJFS\u201d), thereby terminating her parental rights. For the reasons that follow, the judgment of\n\nthe trial court is affirmed.\n\n       I.      Facts and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} Z.A.1, Z.A.2, A.A., and two older siblings were born from the union of Mother\n\nand Father. Neither Father nor the two older siblings are parties to this appeal.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} JFS first became involved with the family in April 2023 after they were evicted\n\nfrom their home due to non-payment of rent and began staying in homeless shelters and\n\nhotels. In addition to the homelessness issue, it was reported that the family of eight\u2014one\n\nof the older siblings had a child of her own\u2014suffered from food insecurity, causing Mother\n\nand Father to often call around to ask for food.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} The agency was again contacted in June 2023 concerning Mother\u2019s and\n\nFather\u2019s alleged drug use. A case worker contacted Father at the Quality Inn in Springfield\n\nwhere they were staying, but he did not cooperate and would not allow the case worker to\n\nsee the children. Father could not tell the case worker when the children had last visited a\n\ndoctor, and Mother later confirmed that none of the children were immunized. They stated\n\nthat although the children did not have a doctor in Springfield, they had went to Marysville\n\n\n                                              2\n\fPediatrics when they lived there. The parents refused to submit to a drug screen but\n\nadmitted to smoking marijuana.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} A \u201cfamily stability meeting\u201d was held in July 2023. Both Mother and Father\n\nrefused to submit to a drug screen and left the meeting before agency recommendations\n\ncould be completed. Later that month, Z.A.1 had a health screening at the Rocking Horse\n\nCenter and was diagnosed with a severe form of \u201clazy eye\u201d; he was referred to Dayton\n\nChildren\u2019s Hospital for treatment, but his parents never made an appointment.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} On September 15, 2023, the case worker received a call from the homeless\n\nshelter where the family was staying, the Executive Inn, due to concerns that Z.A.1, Z.A.2,\n\nand A.A. had been left unsupervised overnight, a violation of the shelter\u2019s rules. Law\n\nenforcement removed the children because Mother and Father could not be located. Due to\n\nthe rules violation, the family was discharged from the shelter program, leaving them without\n\na place to stay. As a result, JFS filed for ex parte custody, which was granted; Z.A.1, Z.A.2,\n\nA.A. and their siblings were placed with a relative. Shortly thereafter, the relative reported\n\nthat she could no longer care for the children, and they were moved to foster care. On\n\nJanuary 26, 2024, the children were placed in the temporary custody of JFS.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} To aid in reunification, a case plan was developed. It required Mother and\n\nFather to (1) have a drug and alcohol assessment and follow recommendations; (2) have a\n\nmental health assessment; (3) submit to random drug screens\u2014with any refusal to be\n\nconsidered a positive; (4) obtain and maintain stable housing; (5) obtain and maintain\n\nemployment and income sufficient to meet the needs of the children and provide paystubs\n\nfor verification; (6) have consistent visitations with children at the visitation center;\n\n(7) maintain contact with the case worker and providers; and (8) sign releases for information\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fat the request of the case worker and providers. Mother refused to sign the plan, and it\n\nbecame an order of the court.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Mother and Father failed to follow through with most of the case plan objectives,\n\nand on February 14, 2025, JFS filed a motion for permanent custody of Z.A.1, Z.A.2, and\n\nA.A. The motion stated that Mother and Father \u201chave not been able to prove they are able\n\nto maintain safe, stable housing, [or] employment for financial means\u201d and that the children\n\nwere doing well in their foster placements.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} The permanent custody hearing was held on May 19, 2025. The trial court heard\n\ntestimony from Ceasyn Bostick, the juvenile court treatment coordinator; Richard Hill, the\n\nfamily\u2019s case worker; and Leslie Buchanan, the guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d). A short time later,\n\nthe court rendered its decision, granting permanent custody of Z.A.1, Z.A.2, and A.A. to JFS\n\nand terminating all parental rights and duties of Mother and Father as to the children.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Mother has filed a timely appeal that raises three assignments of error.\n\n       II.    Permanent Custody\n\n       {\u00b6 11} In her first and second assignments of error, Mother makes related arguments\n\nthat the trial court\u2019s decision granting permanent custody to JFS was against the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence and that the decision was not in the children\u2019s best interest. We\n\ndisagree on both accounts.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} The United States Supreme Court has described parents\u2019 interest in the care,\n\ncustody, and control of their children as \u201cperhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty\n\ninterests recognized by this Court.\u201d Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000). This interest,\n\nhowever, is not absolute. \u201cThe state has broad authority to intervene to protect children from\n\nabuse and neglect.\u201d State ex rel. Allen Cty. Children Servs. Bd. v. Mercer Cty. Common\n\nPleas Court, Probate Div., 2016-Ohio-7382, \u00b6 58 (O'Connor, C.J., dissenting).\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       {\u00b6 13} R.C. 2151.414 sets forth a two-part analysis for courts to consider when\n\ndetermining a motion for permanent custody to a public services agency. First, the trial court\n\nmust find by clear and convincing evidence that the child (a) cannot or should not be placed\n\nwith the parent within a reasonable time; (b) is abandoned; (c) is orphaned with no relatives\n\nabove to take permanent custody; or (d) has been in the temporary custody of a public or\n\nprivate children services agency for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period.\n\nIn re J.N., 2020-Ohio-4157, \u00b6 26 (2d Dist.); R.C. 2151.414(B)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 14} If the first prong is met, the court must then determine whether granting\n\npermanent custody is in the best interest of the child. In re J.N. at \u00b6 26 (2d Dist.);\n\nR.C. 2151.414(B)(1). To help with this determination, R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) sets out factors\n\nthe court must consider:\n\n       (a) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s parents,\n\n       siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any other\n\n       person who may significantly affect the child;\n\n       (b) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through the\n\n       child\u2019s guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;\n\n       (c) The custodial history of the child . . . ;\n\n       (d) The child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether\n\n       that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody\n\n       to the agency;\n\n       (e) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section apply in\n\n       relation to the parents and child.\n\n\u201cNo one element is given greater weight or heightened significance.\u201d In re C.F., 2007-Ohio-\n\n1104, \u00b6 57.\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f       {\u00b6 15} Because R.C. 2151.414 mandates that a juvenile court find by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the statutory requirements are met, the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nand manifest weight standards of review are the proper standards of review, as applicable\n\ndepending on the arguments presented by the parties. In re Z.C., 2023-Ohio-4703, \u00b6 11;\n\nIn re Ca.S., 2021-Ohio-3874, \u00b6 44 (4th Dist.) (a reviewing court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s\n\npermanent custody decision unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence).\n\n       {\u00b6 16} When an appellate court reviews whether the lower court\u2019s permanent custody\n\ndecision is against the manifest weight of the evidence, it \u201cweighs the evidence and all\n\nreasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in\n\nresolving conflicts in the evidence, the finder of fact clearly lost its way and created such a\n\nmanifest miscarriage of justice that the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d\n\n(Cleaned up.) Eastley v. Volkman, 2012-Ohio-2179, \u00b6 20. \u201cThus, if the children services\n\nagency presented competent and credible evidence upon which the trier of fact reasonably\n\ncould have formed a firm belief that permanent custody is warranted, then the court\u2019s\n\ndecision is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d In re R.M., 2013-Ohio-3588,\n\n\u00b6 55 (4th Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b6 17} In resolving the first prong of the two-step R.C. 2151.414 analysis, the trial\n\ncourt found by clear and convincing evidence that Z.A.1, Z.A.2, and A.A. could not have\n\nbeen placed with Mother (or Father) within a reasonable period of time. The court reasoned\n\nthat despite the efforts of the agency, \u201cMother has failed to meet any of her case plan\n\nobjectives except for visiting with her children at the visitation center.\u201d Final Judgment, p. 11.\n\nMother never had stable housing, routinely missed and then all together stopped drug\n\nscreenings, almost always was unemployed, and went long periods of time with no contact\n\nwith the case worker. Given Mother\u2019s failure to make even minimal progress with her case\n\n\n                                                6\n\fplan in the previous year, there was little hope that anything would have changed to have\n\nallowed safe placement of the children back in her care in a reasonable period of time. The\n\ntrial court\u2019s finding was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Having found that the trial court did not err in its determination that Z.A.1,\n\nZ.A.2, and A.A. could not have been placed with Mother in a reasonable period of time as\n\nset forth in R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), we move to the second step in the analysis\u2014determining\n\nwhether granting permanent custody to JFS was in the best interest of the children. The\n\ncourt focused on a few of the R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) factors.\n\n       Interaction and interrelationships of the children\n\n       {\u00b6 19} The court found that minimal evidence was presented at the hearing regarding\n\nthe bond between Mother and the children. Mother did not testify, and the larger case record\n\nis sparse on the interactions between Mother and the children. It is noteworthy that although\n\nMother was mostly compliant with visits, she was apparently unwilling to take the steps\n\nneeded to move past on-site visits with the children. As the GAL wrote, \u201c[Mother] has not\n\nshown that [she] is capable of meeting the children\u2019s needs. Since losing custody of the\n\nchildren, [she has] not made any changes that would positively impact upon [her] ability to\n\nparent these children.\u201d Permanent Custody Recommendation of Guardian Ad Litem, p. 5.\n\nEven if there was fondness shared between Mother and her children, and there almost\n\ncertainly was, her interactions and choices did not reflect positively on her ability to parent.\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Besides the children\u2019s relationships with Mother, they had relationships with\n\ntheir foster caregivers. Evidence showed that Z.A.2 was bonded with her foster family. Z.A.1\n\nwas in a group home due to behavior concerns, but he was thriving there. A staff member\n\nwith whom Z.A.1 had a great relationship was in the process of becoming a licensed foster\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fparent and was interested in fostering him. The needs of the children were being met in their\n\nplacements. That was not the case when they had been living with Mother.\n\n       Wishes of the Children\n\n       {\u00b6 21} Though the children were not interviewed by the court, the GAL report filed on\n\nNovember 24, 2024, indicated that Z.A.1 (age 12 at the permanent custody hearing) did not\n\nwish to return to Mother if things had not changed for the better and that he expressed the\n\ndesire to be placed in a foster home that could lead to adoption. Z.A.2 (age 10 at the\n\nhearing), while expressing that she sought to continue to see her siblings, stated that she\n\nwanted to remain with her foster family. A.A., who was only 7, was considered too young to\n\ntruly understand the issue and its implications.\n\n       Custodial History\n\n       {\u00b6 22} The trial court also reviewed and considered the custodial history of Z.A.1,\n\nZ.A.2, and A.A. After removal from their parents in the fall of 2023, the children were never\n\nreturned. They were initially together in a kinship placement, but that was short-lived, and\n\nthe children were placed together in foster care. In the summer of 2024, Z.A.1 was removed\n\nfrom the home and placed in a group home after allegations were made that he was lying,\n\nstealing, and abusing animals. It was also alleged that he sexually abused another\n\n(unrelated) foster child in the home. Z.A.2 and A.A. were in a foster-to-adopt home and were\n\nhappy. A.A. has played baseball. As the GAL reported, since being placed in foster care,\n\nthe children\u2019s medical, dental, vision, educational, and mental health needs have been met\n\nfor the first time.\n\n       Need for Legally Secure Placement\n\n       {\u00b6 23} While the Ohio Revised Code does not define a \u201clegally secure permanent\n\nplacement,\u201d Ohio courts have held that the phrase means \u201ca safe, stable, consistent\n\n\n                                              8\n\fenvironment where a child\u2019s needs will be met.\u201d In re K.M., 2023-Ohio-3203, \u00b6 35 (4th Dist.).\n\nThe trial court found, and the evidence confirms, that Mother would have had a difficult time\n\nproviding such an environment for her children. Even before JFS became involved with the\n\nfamily, they were living in hotels that acted as homeless shelters. Mother was not employed,\n\nwas using marijuana on an almost daily basis, and was unable or unwilling to attend to the\n\ndental, medical, and educational needs of her children. Because of that, the case worker\n\ndeveloped a plan to address Mother\u2019s shortcomings and facilitate the reunification of the\n\nfamily. Even knowing that improving in these areas would have led to reunification, Mother\n\ndid not act. She refused to meet with the case worker, continued living in other people\u2019s\n\nhomes, provided only one paystub in a year to show employment (for a store that went out\n\nof business), and tested positive for THC when she submitted to drug screens (there were\n\nmonths when she would not test).\n\n       {\u00b6 24} On the other hand, since the children have been under the care of the agency\n\nand in their foster placements, especially the current ones, their needs have been met. The\n\nchildren have had long-overdue dental work completed, they all have been enrolled in\n\nschools where they have the educational help they need, and Z.A.1 has had eye surgery to\n\ncorrect his \u201clazy eye.\u201d In addition, they were in stable living environments, not moving from\n\nhotel to hotel or shelter to shelter, and they were not being exposed to constant drug or\n\nalcohol abuse.\n\n       {\u00b6 25} The trial court\u2019s decision granting permanent custody to JFS was not against\n\nthe manifest of the evidence, and we conclude, as the trial court did, that it was in the best\n\ninterest of the children. Mother\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       III.   Additional Time\n\n       {\u00b6 26} In her third assignment of error, Mother contends that the trial court erred by\n\nnot granting her additional time to complete the case plan.\n\n       {\u00b6 27} According to R.C. 2151.415(D)(1), an agency may request an extension of\n\ntemporary custody for a period of up to six months, if, in its motion, it explains the progress\n\non the case plan and the agency\u2019s expectations of reunifying the child with the family or\n\nplacing the child in a permanent placement. If the motion is filed, the court must have a\n\nhearing to consider the evidence presented by the parties and GAL, and if it determines by\n\nclear and convincing evidence \u201cthat the extension is in the best interest of the child, there\n\nhas been significant progress on the case plan of the child, and there is reasonable cause\n\nto believe that the child will be reunified with one of the parents or otherwise permanently\n\nplaced within the period of extension,\u201d it may grant the motion.

SIMPSON, Attorney for Appellant\nROBERT C. LOGSDON, Attorney for Appellee\n\n\nEPLEY, P.J.\n\n       {\u00b6 1} Mother appeals from the judgment of the Clark County Common Pleas Court,\n\nDomestic Relations Division, Juvenile Section, granting permanent custody of three of her\n\nchildren, Z.A.1, Z.A.2, and A.A., to the Clark County Department of Job and Family Services\n\n(\u201cJFS\u201d), thereby terminating her parental rights. For the reasons that follow, the judgment of\n\nthe trial court is affirmed.\n\n       I.      Facts and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} Z.A.1, Z.A.2, A.A., and two older siblings were born from the union of Mother\n\nand Father. Neither Father nor the two older siblings are parties to this appeal.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} JFS first became involved with the family in April 2023 after they were evicted\n\nfrom their home due to non-payment of rent and began staying in homeless shelters and\n\nhotels. In addition to the homelessness issue, it was reported that the family of eight\u2014one\n\nof the older siblings had a child of her own\u2014suffered from food insecurity, causing Mother\n\nand Father to often call around to ask for food.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} The agency was again contacted in June 2023 concerning Mother\u2019s and\n\nFather\u2019s alleged drug use. A case worker contacted Father at the Quality Inn in Springfield\n\nwhere they were staying, but he did not cooperate and would not allow the case worker to\n\nsee the children. Father could not tell the case worker when the children had last visited a\n\ndoctor, and Mother later confirmed that none of the children were immunized. They stated\n\nthat although the children did not have a doctor in Springfield, they had went to Marysville\n\n\n                                              2\n\fPediatrics when they lived there. The parents refused to submit to a drug screen but\n\nadmitted to smoking marijuana.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} A \u201cfamily stability meeting\u201d was held in July 2023. Both Mother and Father\n\nrefused to submit to a drug screen and left the meeting before agency recommendations\n\ncould be completed. Later that month, Z.A.1 had a health screening at the Rocking Horse\n\nCenter and was diagnosed with a severe form of \u201clazy eye\u201d; he was referred to Dayton\n\nChildren\u2019s Hospital for treatment, but his parents never made an appointment.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} On September 15, 2023, the case worker received a call from the homeless\n\nshelter where the family was staying, the Executive Inn, due to concerns that Z.A.1, Z.A.2,\n\nand A.A. had been left unsupervised overnight, a violation of the shelter\u2019s rules. Law\n\nenforcement removed the children because Mother and Father could not be located. Due to\n\nthe rules violation, the family was discharged from the shelter program, leaving them without\n\na place to stay. As a result, JFS filed for ex parte custody, which was granted; Z.A.1, Z.A.2,\n\nA.A. and their siblings were placed with a relative. Shortly thereafter, the relative reported\n\nthat she could no longer care for the children, and they were moved to foster care. On\n\nJanuary 26, 2024, the children were placed in the temporary custody of JFS.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} To aid in reunification, a case plan was developed. It required Mother and\n\nFather to (1) have a drug and alcohol assessment and follow recommendations; (2) have a\n\nmental health assessment; (3) submit to random drug screens\u2014with any refusal to be\n\nconsidered a positive; (4) obtain and maintain stable housing; (5) obtain and maintain\n\nemployment and income sufficient to meet the needs of the children and provide paystubs\n\nfor verification; (6) have consistent visitations with children at the visitation center;\n\n(7) maintain contact with the case worker and providers; and (8) sign releases for information\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fat the request of the case worker and providers. Mother refused to sign the plan, and it\n\nbecame an order of the court.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Mother and Father failed to follow through with most of the case plan objectives,\n\nand on February 14, 2025, JFS filed a motion for permanent custody of Z.A.1, Z.A.2, and\n\nA.A. The motion stated that Mother and Father \u201chave not been able to prove they are able\n\nto maintain safe, stable housing, [or] employment for financial means\u201d and that the children\n\nwere doing well in their foster placements.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} The permanent custody hearing was held on May 19, 2025. The trial court heard\n\ntestimony from Ceasyn Bostick, the juvenile court treatment coordinator; Richard Hill, the\n\nfamily\u2019s case worker; and Leslie Buchanan, the guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d). A short time later,\n\nthe court rendered its decision, granting permanent custody of Z.A.1, Z.A.2, and A.A. to JFS\n\nand terminating all parental rights and duties of Mother and Father as to the children.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Mother has filed a timely appeal that raises three assignments of error.\n\n       II.    Permanent Custody\n\n       {\u00b6 11} In her first and second assignments of error, Mother makes related arguments\n\nthat the trial court\u2019s decision granting permanent custody to JFS was against the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence and that the decision was not in the children\u2019s best interest. We\n\ndisagree on both accounts.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} The United States Supreme Court has described parents\u2019 interest in the care,\n\ncustody, and control of their children as \u201cperhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty\n\ninterests recognized by this Court.\u201d Troxel v.

First, the trial court\n\nmust find by clear and convincing evidence that the child (a) cannot or should not be placed\n\nwith the parent within a reasonable time; (b) is abandoned; (c) is orphaned with no relatives\n\nabove to take permanent custody; or (d) has been in the temporary custody of a public or\n\nprivate children services agency for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period.\n\nIn re J.N., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4557674\"><a href=\"/opinion/4777327/in-re-jn/#26\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In re J.N.\">2020-Ohio-4157, \u00b6 26</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Dist.); R.C. 2151.414(B)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 14} If the first prong is met, the court must then determine whether granting\n\npermanent custody is in the best interest of the child. In re J.N. at \u00b6 26 (2d Dist.);\n\nR.C. 2151.414(B)(1). To help with this determination, R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) sets out factors\n\nthe court must consider:\n\n       (a) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s parents,\n\n       siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any other\n\n       person who may significantly affect the child;\n\n       (b) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through the\n\n       child\u2019s guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;\n\n       (c) The custodial history of the child . . . ;\n\n       (d) The child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether\n\n       that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody\n\n       to the agency;\n\n       (e) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section apply in\n\n       relation to the parents and child.\n\n\u201cNo one element is given greater weight or heightened significance.\u201d In re C.F., 2007-Ohio-\n\n1104, \u00b6 57.\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f       {\u00b6 15} Because R.C. 2151.414 mandates that a juvenile court find by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the statutory requirements are met, the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nand manifest weight standards of review are the proper standards of review, as applicable\n\ndepending on the arguments presented by the parties.

(a reviewing court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s\n\npermanent custody decision unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence).\n\n       {\u00b6 16} When an appellate court reviews whether the lower court\u2019s permanent custody\n\ndecision is against the manifest weight of the evidence, it \u201cweighs the evidence and all\n\nreasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in\n\nresolving conflicts in the evidence, the finder of fact clearly lost its way and created such a\n\nmanifest miscarriage of justice that the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d\n\n(Cleaned up.)

The court reasoned\n\nthat despite the efforts of the agency, \u201cMother has failed to meet any of her case plan\n\nobjectives except for visiting with her children at the visitation center.\u201d Final Judgment, p. 11.\n\nMother never had stable housing, routinely missed and then all together stopped drug\n\nscreenings, almost always was unemployed, and went long periods of time with no contact\n\nwith the case worker. Given Mother\u2019s failure to make even minimal progress with her case\n\n\n                                                6\n\fplan in the previous year, there was little hope that anything would have changed to have\n\nallowed safe placement of the children back in her care in a reasonable period of time. The\n\ntrial court\u2019s finding was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Having found that the trial court did not err in its determination that Z.A.1,\n\nZ.A.2, and A.A. could not have been placed with Mother in a reasonable period of time as\n\nset forth in R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), we move to the second step in the analysis\u2014determining\n\nwhether granting permanent custody to JFS was in the best interest of the children. The\n\ncourt focused on a few of the R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) factors.\n\n       Interaction and interrelationships of the children\n\n       {\u00b6 19} The court found that minimal evidence was presented at the hearing regarding\n\nthe bond between Mother and the children. Mother did not testify, and the larger case record\n\nis sparse on the interactions between Mother and the children. It is noteworthy that although\n\nMother was mostly compliant with visits, she was apparently unwilling to take the steps\n\nneeded to move past on-site visits with the children. As the GAL wrote, \u201c[Mother] has not\n\nshown that [she] is capable of meeting the children\u2019s needs. Since losing custody of the\n\nchildren, [she has] not made any changes that would positively impact upon [her] ability to\n\nparent these children.\u201d Permanent Custody Recommendation of Guardian Ad Litem, p. 5.\n\nEven if there was fondness shared between Mother and her children, and there almost\n\ncertainly was, her interactions and choices did not reflect positively on her ability to parent.\n\n       {\u00b6 20} Besides the children\u2019s relationships with Mother, they had relationships with\n\ntheir foster caregivers. Evidence showed that Z.A.2 was bonded with her foster family. Z.A.1\n\nwas in a group home due to behavior concerns, but he was thriving there. A staff member\n\nwith whom Z.A.1 had a great relationship was in the process of becoming a licensed foster\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fparent and was interested in fostering him. The needs of the children were being met in their\n\nplacements. That was not the case when they had been living with Mother.\n\n       Wishes of the Children\n\n       {\u00b6 21} Though the children were not interviewed by the court, the GAL report filed on\n\nNovember 24, 2024, indicated that Z.A.1 (age 12 at the permanent custody hearing) did not\n\nwish to return to Mother if things had not changed for the better and that he expressed the\n\ndesire to be placed in a foster home that could lead to adoption. Z.A.2 (age 10 at the\n\nhearing), while expressing that she sought to continue to see her siblings, stated that she\n\nwanted to remain with her foster family. A.A., who was only 7, was considered too young to\n\ntruly understand the issue and its implications.\n\n       Custodial History\n\n       {\u00b6 22} The trial court also reviewed and considered the custodial history of Z.A.1,\n\nZ.A.2, and A.A. After removal from their parents in the fall of 2023, the children were never\n\nreturned. They were initially together in a kinship placement, but that was short-lived, and\n\nthe children were placed together in foster care. In the summer of 2024, Z.A.1 was removed\n\nfrom the home and placed in a group home after allegations were made that he was lying,\n\nstealing, and abusing animals. It was also alleged that he sexually abused another\n\n(unrelated) foster child in the home. Z.A.2 and A.A. were in a foster-to-adopt home and were\n\nhappy. A.A. has played baseball. As the GAL reported, since being placed in foster care,\n\nthe children\u2019s medical, dental, vision, educational, and mental health needs have been met\n\nfor the first time.\n\n       Need for Legally Secure Placement\n\n       {\u00b6 23} While the Ohio Revised Code does not define a \u201clegally secure permanent\n\nplacement,\u201d Ohio courts have held that the phrase means \u201ca safe, stable, consistent\n\n\n                                              8\n\fenvironment where a child\u2019s needs will be met.\u201d In re K.M., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9882538\"><a href=\"/opinion/9430681/in-re-km/#35\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: In re K.M.\">2023-Ohio-3203, \u00b6 35</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Dist.).\n\nThe trial court found, and the evidence confirms, that Mother would have had a difficult time\n\nproviding such an environment for her children. Even before JFS became involved with the\n\nfamily, they were living in hotels that acted as homeless shelters. Mother was not employed,\n\nwas using marijuana on an almost daily basis, and was unable or unwilling to attend to the\n\ndental, medical, and educational needs of her children. Because of that, the case worker\n\ndeveloped a plan to address Mother\u2019s shortcomings and facilitate the reunification of the\n\nfamily. Even knowing that improving in these areas would have led to reunification, Mother\n\ndid not act. She refused to meet with the case worker, continued living in other people\u2019s\n\nhomes, provided only one paystub in a year to show employment (for a store that went out\n\nof business), and tested positive for THC when she submitted to drug screens (there were\n\nmonths when she would not test).\n\n       {\u00b6 24} On the other hand, since the children have been under the care of the agency\n\nand in their foster placements, especially the current ones, their needs have been met. The\n\nchildren have had long-overdue dental work completed, they all have been enrolled in\n\nschools where they have the educational help they need, and Z.A.1 has had eye surgery to\n\ncorrect his \u201clazy eye.\u201d In addition, they were in stable living environments, not moving from\n\nhotel to hotel or shelter to shelter, and they were not being exposed to constant drug or\n\nalcohol abuse.\n\n       {\u00b6 25} The trial court\u2019s decision granting permanent custody to JFS was not against\n\nthe manifest of the evidence, and we conclude, as the trial court did, that it was in the best\n\ninterest of the children. Mother\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       III.   Additional Time\n\n       {\u00b6 26} In her third assignment of error, Mother contends that the trial court erred by\n\nnot granting her additional time to complete the case plan.\n\n       {\u00b6 27} According to R.C. 2151.415(D)(1), an agency may request an extension of\n\ntemporary custody for a period of up to six months, if, in its motion, it explains the progress\n\non the case plan and the agency\u2019s expectations of reunifying the child with the family or\n\nplacing the child in a permanent placement. If the motion is filed, the court must have a\n\nhearing to consider the evidence presented by the parties and GAL, and if it determines by\n\nclear and convincing evidence \u201cthat the extension is in the best interest of the child, there\n\nhas been significant progress on the case plan of the child, and there is reasonable cause\n\nto believe that the child will be reunified with one of the parents or otherwise permanently\n\nplaced within the period of extension,\u201d it may grant the motion. R.C. 2151.415(D)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 28} Mother\u2019s argument fails for two reasons. First, no one asked for an extension.\n\nSecond, nothing in the record indicates that an additional six months would have changed\n\nanything.

ANDERSON, Attorney for Appellant\nJANE A. NAPIER and KARA N. RICHTER, Attorneys for Appellee\n\n\nTUCKER, J.\n\n       {\u00b6 1} Paul M. Celaya appeals from his convictions in the Champaign County Common\n\nPleas Court of aggravated possession of drugs and failure to appear. For the following\n\nreasons, we affirm.\n\n                          I.      Factual and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} In February 2024, Celaya was indicted on one count of aggravated possession\n\nof drugs. Following arraignment, he was released on his own recognizance. After Celaya\n\nfailed to appear for the final pretrial conference in April of 2024, the trial court issued a\n\ncapias. In May 2024, Celaya was indicted on one count of failure to appear in violation of\n\nR.C. 2937.29 and R.C. 2937.99(A). Celaya did not appear again in court until he was\n\narrested in November 2024 following a traffic stop in Englewood.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} This matter proceeded to a jury trial during which the State presented the\n\ntestimony of Champaign County Deputy Sheriff Daniel Fischer. Fischer was on routine patrol\n\non January 18, 2024, when at approximately 11:38 p.m., he observed a vehicle driving\n\ntoward him with a non-working headlight. Fischer initiated a traffic stop of the vehicle and\n\napproached the driver, Celaya. While speaking with Celaya, Fischer noticed a \u201cbutane torch-\n\nstyle lighter laying on the passenger seat, and then under the radio was a compartment that\n\nhad numerous Q-tips in the compartment.\u201d Fischer testified that butane lighters are \u201ctypically\n\nused for drug use because it burns hotter than a normal lighter,\u201d and drug users \u201cwill take\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fthe cotton off the [Q-tip] and use that as a filter for the drugs that they\u2019re drawing into a\n\nsyringe.\"\n\n         {\u00b6 4} During the encounter, Fischer learned that Celaya was on his way to pick up a\n\nfemale friend named Rusty Smith. Fischer testified that a BOLO alert had been issued for\n\nRusty Smith, who was wanted by law enforcement in connection with a stolen car and \u201cactive\n\nwarrants out of Champaign County.\u201d1\n\n         {\u00b6 5} Fischer asked Celaya to step out of his vehicle so that he could have his K-9\n\nperform a free-air sniff of the car. According to Fischer, the K-9 alerted at the driver\u2019s door.\n\nFischer then searched the car and saw a \u201cglass owl that was filled with water tucked between\n\nthe [driver\u2019s] seat and the console.\u201d The owl was not completely visible, and Fischer did not\n\nremove it from its location. Fischer believed the owl was a \u201cmarijuana bong.\u201d Fischer then\n\nspoke with Celaya about helping him locate Smith. Celaya indicated that he did not want to\n\ndo so. Fischer released Celaya because he was not in possession of felony-level drugs.\n\n         {\u00b6 6} Approximately 40 minutes later, Fischer encountered Celaya at a local gas\n\nstation. Fischer \u201cthought . . . [Celaya] could have gone back to pick [Rusty] up.\u201d Fischer\n\nentered the gas station convenience store to look for Rusty, but she was not in the store.\n\nFischer exited and approached the passenger door of Celaya\u2019s vehicle. Celaya rolled the\n\nwindow down. Fischer again saw the owl he had noticed earlier, now in plain view in the\n\npassenger seat. Fischer testified that he \u201cinstantly recognized it as a meth pipe\u201d because he\n\n\u201ccould see the globe on the pipe . . . and it had a white and red residue consistent with\n\nmethamphetamine.\u201d Fischer searched the vehicle again, collected the pipe, and released\n\nCelaya.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    BOLO is an acronym for \u201cbe on the lookout.\u201d\n\n                                               3\n\f       {\u00b6 7} The parties stipulated that the glass pipe contained methamphetamine residue.\n\nThe State\u2019s evidence revealed that Celaya completed an \u201cown recognizance bond form\u201d\n\nstating that he was required to appear at all court hearings and that failure to do so would\n\nrender the bond void. The State\u2019s evidence indicated that Celaya was in court when the\n\njudge set a date for the final pre-trial hearing and the trial. The State\u2019s evidence further\n\nindicated that Celaya had failed to appear for the final pre-trial hearing.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Celaya testified that he was driving to pick up a female friend when he was\n\npulled over by Fischer. Celaya testified Fischer asked him to help locate Rusty Smith, but\n\nhe denied the request. Fischer had his K-9 conduct a sniff of the vehicle. Celaya maintained\n\nthat the K-9 failed to alert, and at the time, he had pointed out the failure to Fischer. Celaya\n\nclaimed that Fischer \u201cdid not like\u201d his statement so he forced the dog back to the vehicle and\n\npretended that the K-9 had alerted. Celaya testified that Fischer searched his vehicle,\n\nlocated the \u201cweed bong,\u201d and stated that he \u201cdid not give a shit\u201d about it. After Fischer\n\nreleased Celaya, he went to a gas station where he again encountered Fischer. Celaya\n\ntestified that Fischer approached the passenger side of his vehicle and asked him if Rusty\n\nSmith was with him. Fischer then looked down at the bong and stated, \u201cI did not realize that\n\nwas a meth bong.\u201d Fischer took the bong and allowed Celaya to leave. As for Celaya\u2019s failure\n\nto appear for his final pretrial conference, Celaya said that he had not intended to miss his\n\ncourt date. Celaya testified that he had worked late the night before and accidentally slept\n\nthrough the hearing time.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} The jury found Celaya guilty of both charges. The trial court imposed an\n\naggregate prison term of 28 months. Celaya appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                          II.    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n       {\u00b6 10} Celaya\u2019s assignment of error states:\n\n       APPELLANT WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL BECAUSE HE\n\n       WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} Celaya asserts his convictions should be reversed because his attorney\n\nprovided ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} We review alleged instances of ineffective assistance of counsel under the\n\ntwo-part analysis found in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), which the Ohio\n\nSupreme Court adopted in State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136 (1989). To prevail on an\n\nineffective-assistance claim, a defendant must show trial counsel rendered deficient\n\nperformance and that counsel's deficient performance prejudiced him. Strickland at\n\nparagraph two of the syllabus; Bradley at paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n       {\u00b6 13} Courts determine deficient performance by asking whether counsel's conduct\n\n\u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d Strickland at 688. When making this\n\ndetermination, counsel\u2019s conduct must be judged based on \u201cthe facts of the particular case,\n\nviewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d Id. at 690. Only when counsel\u2019s errors were \u201cso\n\nserious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the\n\nSixth Amendment\u201d has counsel engaged in deficient performance. Id. at 687.\n\n       {\u00b6 14} To establish prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would\n\nhave been different.\u201d Id. at 694. This requires the errors to be so significant as to \u201cundermine\n\nconfidence in the outcome.\u201d Id. The failure to make a showing of either prong of the\n\nStrickland inquiry is fatal to a claim of ineffective assistance. Id. at 692.\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f       {\u00b6 15} Celaya first claims trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a\n\n\u201ccoherent defense\u201d to the charge of aggravated possession of drugs. In support, he contends\n\ncounsel did not present evidence to dispute any of the elements of the offense and that\n\ncounsel, instead, argued merely that it was unfair for Fischer to get a \u201cdo-over\u201d or second\n\n\u201cgo-around\u201d at seizing the pipe.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} Counsel\u2019s defense to the drug possession count was an attack on Fischer\u2019s\n\ncredibility regarding the two encounters with Celaya and the seizure of the pipe during the\n\nsecond encounter. This attack was accomplished through counsel\u2019s cross-examination of\n\nFischer and Celaya\u2019s direct testimony.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} Regardless of the effectiveness of this defense, we cannot agree, especially\n\nin light of the \u201chand counsel was dealt,\u201d that the defense was incoherent or that it was\n\nimproper trial strategy. We do not conclude that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Trial counsel is entitled to a strong presumption that his or her conduct falls\n\nwithin the wide range of reasonable assistance. State v. Dunn, 2024-Ohio-600, \u00b6 19\n\n(2d Dist.). \u201cDebatable strategic and tactical decisions may not form the basis of a claim for\n\nineffective assistance of counsel, even if, in hindsight, it looks as if a better strategy had\n\nbeen available.\u201d State v. Hall, 2021-Ohio-1894, \u00b6 55 (2d Dist.), citing State v. Cook, 65 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 516, 524 (1992). This court will not second-guess decisions of counsel that may be\n\nconsidered matters of strategy. Id., citing State v. Smith, 17 Ohio St.3d 98 (1985).\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Celaya also contends counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to\n\nsuppress evidence discovered during his two encounters with Fischer.\n\n       {\u00b6 20} \u201c[F]ailure to file a motion to suppress is not per se ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel.\u201d State v. Madrigal, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 389 (2000), citing Kimmelman v. Morrison,\n\n477 U.S. 365, 384 (1986). Rather, to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel for failure\n\n\n                                              6\n\fto file a motion to suppress, a defendant must \u201cestablish that a basis existed to suppress\u201d\n\nthe evidence in question. State v. Adams, 2004-Ohio-5845, \u00b6 35. \u201c\u2018Thus, the failure to file a\n\nmotion to suppress constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel only when the record\n\nestablishes that the motion would have been successful if made.\u2019\u201d State v. Geralds, 2025-\n\nOhio-2209, \u00b6 25 (1st Dist.), quoting State v. Rosemond, 2019-Ohio-5356, \u00b6 34 (1st Dist.).\n\n\u201c[E]ven when some evidence in the record supports a motion to suppress,\u201d an appellate\n\ncourt will presume that defense counsel was effective if \u201ccounsel could reasonably have\n\ndecided that the motion to suppress would have been futile.\u201d State v. Brown, 2002-Ohio-\n\n5455, \u00b6 11 (12th Dist.). Accord State v. Edwards, 1996 WL 388761, *2 (8th Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b6 21} With respect to the first encounter, the traffic stop, Celaya claims his attorney\n\nshould have challenged whether the K-9 unit was properly certified and trained for drug\n\ndetection. Celaya further asserts the record established a dispute as to whether the K-9\n\nalerted during the open-air sniff of the vehicle. Specifically, Celaya testified the dog failed to\n\n\u201chit\u201d on his car but Fischer \u201cgrabbed his dog by the collar and forced him on my car . . . acting\n\nlike he hit. But the dog didn\u2019t hit.\u201d He argues that \u201cchallenging the dog\u2019s alert\u201d in a motion to\n\nsuppress \u201ccould have resulted in the suppression of the probable cause search of the vehicle\n\nand the deputy\u2019s observations during that search, including the discovery of the \u2018bong.\u2019\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 22} With respect to the second encounter at the gas station, Celaya argues that\n\nFischer had no probable cause for confiscating the pipe. In support, he claims the encounter\n\nwas not consensual but rather was \u201ceffectively a stop.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 23} We begin with the second encounter and note that the Fourth Amendment to\n\nthe United States Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and\n\nseizures. State v. Taylor, 106 Ohio App.3d 741, 747 (2d Dist. 1995). This protection,\n\nhowever, is not implicated in every interaction an individual has with a police officer. State\n\n\n                                                7\n\fv. Schott, 1997 WL 254141, *2 (2d Dist.). \u201cThe law recognizes three types of police-citizen\n\ninteractions: 1) a consensual encounter, 2) a brief investigatory stop or detention, and 3) an\n\narrest.\u201d State v. Millerton, 2015-Ohio-34, \u00b6 20 (2d Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b6 24} A consensual encounter occurs when \u201cthe police merely approach a person in\n\na public place, engage the person in conversation, request information, and the person is\n\nfree not to answer and walk away.\u201d Taylor at 747. Consensual encounters are not seizures,\n\nand the Fourth Amendment guarantees are not implicated in such an encounter. Id. at 747-\n\n748. \u201cWhether a particular police encounter with a citizen is an investigative stop, as\n\nopposed to a consensual encounter, is fact-sensitive.\u201d State v. Weisgarber, 2017-Ohio-\n\n8764, \u00b6 19 (2d Dist.). \u201c[T]he focus is on the police officer's conduct, not the subjective state\n\nof mind of the person stopped.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 18, citing State v. Ramey, 2016-Ohio-607, \u00b6 25\n\n(2d Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b6 25} This court has previously held that approaching and questioning people seated\n\nin a parked vehicle does not constitute a seizure so as to require an officer to have a\n\nreasonable suspicion of criminal activity. State v. Williams, 2010-Ohio-4277, \u00b6 26 (2d Dist.),\n\nquoting Schott at *3.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} Here, Fischer was at the gas station and noticed Celaya\u2019s car sitting at the\n\npumps. Fischer walked up to Celaya\u2019s passenger window, and Celaya rolled down the\n\nwindow. Fischer saw the entire owl plainly visible on the passenger seat and realized that it\n\nwas a meth bong. According to Fischer, he told Celaya that he initially thought the owl was\n\na marijuana bong and had not realized it was a meth pipe. He then collected the pipe.\n\nCelaya\u2019s testimony did not rebut or challenge this testimony except to add that Fischer again\n\nasked him about Rusty. Celaya indicated only he had felt \u201charassed\u201d and \u201cnervous.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f       {\u00b6 27} As conceded by Celaya, he was sitting in his vehicle in a public space when\n\nFischer approached him. Celaya does not dispute that the meth pipe was in plain view and\n\nvisible to Fischer without a search. There simply is nothing to support the claim that this\n\nconstituted a stop. The mere fact that Celaya felt nervous or \u201charassed\u201d was not a sufficient\n\nbasis to find that a stop had occurred.\n\n       {\u00b6 28} On this record we find no basis upon which Celaya\u2019s counsel could have filed\n\na motion to suppress. Celaya\u2019s counsel was not ineffective in declining to pursue\n\nsuppression of the meth pipe that Fischer saw in plain view during his consensual encounter\n\nwith Celaya.\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Based on our conclusion in relation to Fischer\u2019s second encounter with Celaya,\n\neven if counsel had performed deficiently by failing to file a motion to suppress regarding\n\nthe first encounter, Celaya cannot demonstrate prejudice. Regardless of the propriety of the\n\nfirst search, Fischer\u2019s lawful recovery of the pipe during the second encounter provided the\n\nonly evidence required to charge and convict Celaya of aggravated possession of drugs.\n\nCelaya has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel related to either of his\n\ninteractions with Fischer.\n\n       {\u00b6 30} Finally, Celaya claims counsel was deficient because he failed to present any\n\ndefense to the charge of failure to appear.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} The transcript establishes that the State presented sufficient evidence to prove\n\nthe offense. During the State\u2019s cross-examination of Celaya, he testified that he had missed\n\nthe court appearance because he had overslept due to having been required to work late\n\nthe night before. Celaya added that he had not intended to miss the hearing.\n\n       {\u00b6 32} The transcript demonstrates that Celaya\u2019s trial counsel informed the court that\n\nthe decision not to question Celaya about the offense and the omission of any mention of\n\n\n                                              9\n\fthe offense from the defense\u2019s opening statement and closing argument were matters of trial\n\nstrategy discussed with Celaya. Celaya addressed the court at the time defense counsel\n\nmade this statement and did not raise any claim to the contrary.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} We are not privy to the reasoning behind this strategy, but it is quite possible\n\nthat counsel simply had concluded that he could not present a good faith defense to the\n\ncharge. In any event, this record does not permit a finding that counsel was ineffective.\n\n       {\u00b6 34} Because Celaya has failed to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was\n\ndeficient or that any deficient performance resulted in prejudice, his assignment of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                     III.

ANDERSON, Attorney for Appellant\nJANE A. NAPIER and KARA N. RICHTER, Attorneys for Appellee\n\n\nTUCKER, J.\n\n       {\u00b6 1} Paul M. Celaya appeals from his convictions in the Champaign County Common\n\nPleas Court of aggravated possession of drugs and failure to appear. For the following\n\nreasons, we affirm.\n\n                          I.      Factual and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} In February 2024, Celaya was indicted on one count of aggravated possession\n\nof drugs. Following arraignment, he was released on his own recognizance. After Celaya\n\nfailed to appear for the final pretrial conference in April of 2024, the trial court issued a\n\ncapias. In May 2024, Celaya was indicted on one count of failure to appear in violation of\n\nR.C. 2937.29 and R.C. 2937.99(A). Celaya did not appear again in court until he was\n\narrested in November 2024 following a traffic stop in Englewood.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} This matter proceeded to a jury trial during which the State presented the\n\ntestimony of Champaign County Deputy Sheriff Daniel Fischer. Fischer was on routine patrol\n\non January 18, 2024, when at approximately 11:38 p.m., he observed a vehicle driving\n\ntoward him with a non-working headlight. Fischer initiated a traffic stop of the vehicle and\n\napproached the driver, Celaya. While speaking with Celaya, Fischer noticed a \u201cbutane torch-\n\nstyle lighter laying on the passenger seat, and then under the radio was a compartment that\n\nhad numerous Q-tips in the compartment.\u201d Fischer testified that butane lighters are \u201ctypically\n\nused for drug use because it burns hotter than a normal lighter,\u201d and drug users \u201cwill take\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fthe cotton off the [Q-tip] and use that as a filter for the drugs that they\u2019re drawing into a\n\nsyringe.&quot;\n\n         {\u00b6 4} During the encounter, Fischer learned that Celaya was on his way to pick up a\n\nfemale friend named Rusty Smith. Fischer testified that a BOLO alert had been issued for\n\nRusty Smith, who was wanted by law enforcement in connection with a stolen car and \u201cactive\n\nwarrants out of Champaign County.\u201d1\n\n         {\u00b6 5} Fischer asked Celaya to step out of his vehicle so that he could have his K-9\n\nperform a free-air sniff of the car. According to Fischer, the K-9 alerted at the driver\u2019s door.\n\nFischer then searched the car and saw a \u201cglass owl that was filled with water tucked between\n\nthe [driver\u2019s] seat and the console.\u201d The owl was not completely visible, and Fischer did not\n\nremove it from its location. Fischer believed the owl was a \u201cmarijuana bong.\u201d Fischer then\n\nspoke with Celaya about helping him locate Smith. Celaya indicated that he did not want to\n\ndo so. Fischer released Celaya because he was not in possession of felony-level drugs.\n\n         {\u00b6 6} Approximately 40 minutes later, Fischer encountered Celaya at a local gas\n\nstation. Fischer \u201cthought . . . [Celaya] could have gone back to pick [Rusty] up.\u201d Fischer\n\nentered the gas station convenience store to look for Rusty, but she was not in the store.\n\nFischer exited and approached the passenger door of Celaya\u2019s vehicle. Celaya rolled the\n\nwindow down. Fischer again saw the owl he had noticed earlier, now in plain view in the\n\npassenger seat. Fischer testified that he \u201cinstantly recognized it as a meth pipe\u201d because he\n\n\u201ccould see the globe on the pipe . . . and it had a white and red residue consistent with\n\nmethamphetamine.\u201d Fischer searched the vehicle again, collected the pipe, and released\n\nCelaya.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    BOLO is an acronym for \u201cbe on the lookout.\u201d\n\n                                               3\n\f       {\u00b6 7} The parties stipulated that the glass pipe contained methamphetamine residue.\n\nThe State\u2019s evidence revealed that Celaya completed an \u201cown recognizance bond form\u201d\n\nstating that he was required to appear at all court hearings and that failure to do so would\n\nrender the bond void. The State\u2019s evidence indicated that Celaya was in court when the\n\njudge set a date for the final pre-trial hearing and the trial. The State\u2019s evidence further\n\nindicated that Celaya had failed to appear for the final pre-trial hearing.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Celaya testified that he was driving to pick up a female friend when he was\n\npulled over by Fischer. Celaya testified Fischer asked him to help locate Rusty Smith, but\n\nhe denied the request. Fischer had his K-9 conduct a sniff of the vehicle. Celaya maintained\n\nthat the K-9 failed to alert, and at the time, he had pointed out the failure to Fischer. Celaya\n\nclaimed that Fischer \u201cdid not like\u201d his statement so he forced the dog back to the vehicle and\n\npretended that the K-9 had alerted. Celaya testified that Fischer searched his vehicle,\n\nlocated the \u201cweed bong,\u201d and stated that he \u201cdid not give a shit\u201d about it. After Fischer\n\nreleased Celaya, he went to a gas station where he again encountered Fischer. Celaya\n\ntestified that Fischer approached the passenger side of his vehicle and asked him if Rusty\n\nSmith was with him. Fischer then looked down at the bong and stated, \u201cI did not realize that\n\nwas a meth bong.\u201d Fischer took the bong and allowed Celaya to leave. As for Celaya\u2019s failure\n\nto appear for his final pretrial conference, Celaya said that he had not intended to miss his\n\ncourt date. Celaya testified that he had worked late the night before and accidentally slept\n\nthrough the hearing time.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} The jury found Celaya guilty of both charges. The trial court imposed an\n\naggregate prison term of 28 months. Celaya appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                          II.

In support, he contends\n\ncounsel did not present evidence to dispute any of the elements of the offense and that\n\ncounsel, instead, argued merely that it was unfair for Fischer to get a \u201cdo-over\u201d or second\n\n\u201cgo-around\u201d at seizing the pipe.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} Counsel\u2019s defense to the drug possession count was an attack on Fischer\u2019s\n\ncredibility regarding the two encounters with Celaya and the seizure of the pipe during the\n\nsecond encounter. This attack was accomplished through counsel\u2019s cross-examination of\n\nFischer and Celaya\u2019s direct testimony.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} Regardless of the effectiveness of this defense, we cannot agree, especially\n\nin light of the \u201chand counsel was dealt,\u201d that the defense was incoherent or that it was\n\nimproper trial strategy.

Celaya further asserts the record established a dispute as to whether the K-9\n\nalerted during the open-air sniff of the vehicle.

Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2010-Ohio-4277</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 26 (2d Dist.),\n\nquoting </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Schott at *3</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} Here, Fischer was at the gas station and noticed Celaya\u2019s car sitting at the\n\npumps. Fischer walked up to Celaya\u2019s passenger window, and Celaya rolled down the\n\nwindow. Fischer saw the entire owl plainly visible on the passenger seat and realized that it\n\nwas a meth bong. According to Fischer, he told Celaya that he initially thought the owl was\n\na marijuana bong and had not realized it was a meth pipe. He then collected the pipe.\n\nCelaya\u2019s testimony did not rebut or challenge this testimony except to add that Fischer again\n\nasked him about Rusty. Celaya indicated only he had felt \u201charassed\u201d and \u201cnervous.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f       {\u00b6 27} As conceded by Celaya, he was sitting in his vehicle in a public space when\n\nFischer approached him. Celaya does not dispute that the meth pipe was in plain view and\n\nvisible to Fischer without a search. There simply is nothing to support the claim that this\n\nconstituted a stop. The mere fact that Celaya felt nervous or \u201charassed\u201d was not a sufficient\n\nbasis to find that a stop had occurred.\n\n       {\u00b6 28} On this record we find no basis upon which Celaya\u2019s counsel could have filed\n\na motion to suppress. Celaya\u2019s counsel was not ineffective in declining to pursue\n\nsuppression of the meth pipe that Fischer saw in plain view during his consensual encounter\n\nwith Celaya.\n\n       {\u00b6 29} Based on our conclusion in relation to Fischer\u2019s second encounter with Celaya,\n\neven if counsel had performed deficiently by failing to file a motion to suppress regarding\n\nthe first encounter, Celaya cannot demonstrate prejudice. Regardless of the propriety of the\n\nfirst search, Fischer\u2019s lawful recovery of the pipe during the second encounter provided the\n\nonly evidence required to charge and convict Celaya of aggravated possession of drugs.\n\nCelaya has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel related to either of his\n\ninteractions with Fischer.\n\n       {\u00b6 30} Finally, Celaya claims counsel was deficient because he failed to present any\n\ndefense to the charge of failure to appear.\n\n       {\u00b6 31} The transcript establishes that the State presented sufficient evidence to prove\n\nthe offense. During the State\u2019s cross-examination of Celaya, he testified that he had missed\n\nthe court appearance because he had overslept due to having been required to work late\n\nthe night before. Celaya added that he had not intended to miss the hearing.\n\n       {\u00b6 32} The transcript demonstrates that Celaya\u2019s trial counsel informed the court that\n\nthe decision not to question Celaya about the offense and the omission of any mention of\n\n\n                                              9\n\fthe offense from the defense\u2019s opening statement and closing argument were matters of trial\n\nstrategy discussed with Celaya. Celaya addressed the court at the time defense counsel\n\nmade this statement and did not raise any claim to the contrary.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} We are not privy to the reasoning behind this strategy, but it is quite possible\n\nthat counsel simply had concluded that he could not present a good faith defense to the\n\ncharge. In any event, this record does not permit a finding that counsel was ineffective.\n\n       {\u00b6 34} Because Celaya has failed to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was\n\ndeficient or that any deficient performance resulted in prejudice, his assignment of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                     III.   Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 35} Having overruled Celaya\u2019s assignment of error, the judgment of the trial court\n\nis affirmed.\n\n                                       .............\n\nLEWIS, J., and HUFFMAN, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "ordering_key": null, "main_version": null, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/2768647/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/3754193/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/4467935/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/4692990/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/6758786/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/6761745/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/6766087/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/6780636/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/9429592/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/9430614/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/9943451/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/11206872/", "id": 11206872, "absolute_url": "/opinion/10740287/state-v-monroe/", "cluster_id": 10740287, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/clusters/10740287/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2025-11-21T07:18:57.829580-08:00", "date_modified": "2025-11-21T07:18:58.565844-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "ad906502e76177aca28936a0614a287218754c87", "page_count": 8, "download_url": "https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/2/2025/2025-Ohio-5248.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2025/11/21/state_v._monroe.pdf", "plain_text": "[Cite as State v.

WILDER, Attorney for Appellant\nKARA N. RICHTER, Attorney for Appellee\n\n\nLEWIS, J.\n\n        {\u00b6 1} Defendant-Appellant Randolph Monroe appeals from his convictions in the\n\nChampaign County Common Pleas Court following his guilty pleas.           For the following\n\nreasons, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n\n\n   I.       Course of Proceedings\n\n        {\u00b6 1} On July 1, 2024, in Champaign C.P. No. 2024 CR 086, Monroe was indicted by\n\na Champaign County grand jury on two counts of aggravated possession of drugs, fifth-\n\ndegree felonies in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). These offenses related to events that\n\noccurred on June 23, 2024.\n\n        {\u00b6 2} On October 7, 2024, in Champaign C.P. No. 2024 CR 144, Monroe was indicted\n\nby a Champaign County grand jury on two counts of aggravated possession of drugs, fifth-\n\ndegree felonies in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). These offenses related to events that\n\noccurred on September 22, 2024. Monroe pleaded not guilty in both of his criminal cases.\n\n        {\u00b6 3} On November 7, 2024, the trial court issued a journal entry finding bond\n\nviolations in both of Monroe\u2019s criminal cases after he admitted to using illegal controlled\n\nsubstances in October and November 2024 and to failing to attend TCN Intensive Outpatient\n\ntreatment.\n\n        {\u00b6 4} On November 18, 2024, the State filed a motion to revoke bond in both cases\n\ndue to Monroe\u2019s alleged failure to be a law-abiding citizen as required in his conditions of\n\nbond. According to the State, Monroe had been charged with driving under suspension in\n\n                                              2\n\fa Champaign County Municipal Court case and failed to appear for his scheduled court\n\nhearing.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} On December 2, 2024, the State filed a bill of information in Case No. 2024 CR\n\n144 charging Monroe with one count of operating a vehicle while under the influence of a\n\nlisted controlled substance (\u201cOVI\u201d), a first-degree misdemeanor in violation of\n\nR.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(j). Monroe pleaded not guilty to this additional count.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} On December 3, 2024, the trial court issued an entry finding additional bond\n\nviolations in Monroe\u2019s two criminal cases based on his admissions that he drove under\n\nsuspension in November 2024 and tested positive for alcohol in December 2024.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} On December 23, 2024, the trial court found Monroe guilty of additional bond\n\nviolations after he admitted to testing positive for cocaine and alcohol and failing to follow\n\nan order of pretrial services.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Monroe and the State entered into a plea agreement to resolve Case Nos. 2024\n\nCR 086 and 2024 CR 144. In Case No. 2024 CR 144, he pleaded guilty to OVI and to one\n\ncount of aggravated possession of drugs, and in Case No. 2024 CR 086, he pleaded guilty\n\nto one count of aggravated possession of drugs. In return for Monroe\u2019s guilty pleas, the\n\nState agreed to request dismissal of the remaining counts of aggravated possession of drugs\n\nin Case Nos. 2024 CR 086 and 2024 CR 144. The trial court accepted Monroe\u2019s guilty\n\npleas and found him guilty of two counts of aggravated possession of drugs and one count\n\nof OVI. The court dismissed the remaining counts in his two criminal cases.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} On January 31, 2025, following a sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced\n\nMonroe to 12 months in prison in Case No. 2024 CR 086 and to 12 months in prison for\n\naggravated possession of drugs and 150 days in jail for OVI in Case No. 2024 CR 144. The\n\ncourt ran the sentences in Case No. 2024 CR 144 concurrently with each other but\n\n\n                                              3\n\fconsecutive to the sentence in Case No. 2024 CR 086, for a total prison sentence of\n\n24 months.      In imposing consecutive sentences, the trial court found that consecutive\n\nsentencing was necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish Monroe and\n\nthat consecutive sentences were not disproportionate to the seriousness of Monroe\u2019s\n\nconduct and to the danger Monroe poses to the public. R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). The court\n\nalso found that Monroe\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrated that consecutive\n\nsentences were necessary to protect the public from future crime by Monroe.\n\nR.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(c). The court ordered Monroe to pay court costs and fines.\n\n         {\u00b6 10} Monroe timely appealed.\n\n\n   II.      Assignment of Error\n\n         {\u00b6 11} Monroe\u2019s assignment of error states:\n\n         The record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding of a consecutive sentence.\n\n         {\u00b6 12} In reviewing felony sentences, appellate courts must apply the standard of\n\nreview set forth in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). State v. Marcum, 2016-Ohio-1002, \u00b6 21. Under\n\nthis statute, an appellate court may increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence, or it\n\nmay vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing, only if it \u201cclearly and convincingly\u201d\n\nfinds either: (1) that the record does not support certain specified findings (including those\n\nin R.C. 2929.14(C)(4), which concern the imposition of consecutive sentences); or (2) that\n\nthe sentence imposed is otherwise contrary to law.          R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).      \u201cClear and\n\nconvincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof which is more than a mere\n\n\u2018preponderance of the evidence,\u2019 but not to the extent of such certainty as is required\n\n\u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 in criminal cases, and which will produce in the mind of the trier\n\nof facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u201d Cross v. Ledford,\n\n161 Ohio St. 469 (1954), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n                                                4\n\f       {\u00b6 13} \u201cOhio law presumes that a defendant convicted of multiple crimes will serve\n\nhis sentences concurrently.\u201d State v. Glover, 2024-Ohio-5195, \u00b6 38, citing R.C. 2929.41(A).\n\nA trial court may, however, impose consecutive sentences when the law specifically permits\n\nit to do so, such as the exception provided by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). Glover at \u00b6 38, citing\n\nR.C. 2929.41(A). Under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4), to impose consecutive sentences, the trial\n\ncourt must find that: (1) \u201cthe consecutive service is necessary to protect the public from\n\nfuture crime or to punish the offender\u201d; (2) \u201cconsecutive sentences are not disproportionate\n\nto the seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the\n\npublic\u201d; and (3) one or more of the following apply:\n\n              (a) The offender committed one or more of the multiple offenses while\n\n       the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a sanction imposed\n\n       pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was\n\n       under post-release control for a prior offense.\n\n              (b) At least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part of one\n\n       or more courses of conduct, and the harm caused by two or more of the\n\n       multiple offenses so committed was so great or unusual that no single prison\n\n       term for any of the offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct\n\n       adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct.\n\n              (c) The offender\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that\n\n       consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime\n\n       by the offender.\n\nOnly one of the three potential findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(a)-(c) is required to impose\n\nconsecutive sentences. State v. Parrish, 2023-Ohio-2409, \u00b6 24 (2d Dist.).\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f      {\u00b6 14} To impose consecutive prison sentences, \u201ca trial court is required to make the\n\nfindings mandated by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) at the sentencing hearing and incorporate its\n\nfindings into its sentencing entry, but it has no obligation to state reasons to support its\n\nfindings.\u201d State v. Bonnell, 2014-Ohio-3177, syllabus. Under R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), \u201cwhere\n\na trial court properly makes the findings mandated by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4), an appellate court\n\nmay not reverse the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences unless it first clearly\n\nand convincingly finds that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s findings.\u201d State v.\n\nWithrow, 2016-Ohio-2884, \u00b6 38 (2d Dist.). This is a deferential standard of review of the\n\ntrial court\u2019s consecutive-sentence findings, and it prohibits an appellate court from simply\n\nsubstituting its judgment for that of the trial court. State v. Gwynne, 2023-Ohio-3851, \u00b6 15.\n\n      {\u00b6 15} Monroe argues that there is no evidence in the record that a consecutive\n\nsentence was necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief, p. 4.   He further contends that the imposition of consecutive prison\n\nsentences for two fifth-degree felony possession convictions was disproportionate to the\n\nseriousness of his conduct and the danger he posed to the public. According to Monroe,\n\nhe clearly \u201chad an issue staying clean. There is no evidence that he posed a danger to the\n\npublic. He posed a danger to himself by failing to remain drug-free. His acts of possessing\n\ndrugs were not posing a danger to the public.\u201d Id. at p. 4-5.\n\n      {\u00b6 16} The State responds that the record provided a substantial basis for the\n\nimposition of consecutive prison sentences. According to the State, the following facts\n\nsupported the consecutive prison sentences:        Monroe\u2019s two felony drug possession\n\noffenses arose from two separate traffic stops approximately three months apart; his driver\u2019s\n\nlicense was suspended at the time of both traffic stops; he admitted to recent drinking and\n\ndrug use and had drug paraphernalia inside the vehicle; his conviction for OVI is an\n\n\n                                             6\n\finherently dangerous crime that places the public at risk of harm; he had a number of bond\n\nviolations; he had a history of juvenile adjudications; and as an adult, he had a lengthy felony\n\nhistory and two prior OVI convictions. Appellee\u2019s Brief, p. 5. The State contends that the\n\ncircumstances surrounding Monroe\u2019s two separate drug possession cases \u201cindicate that\n\nconsecutive sentences were not disproportionate to the seriousness of his conduct and\n\ndanger he posed to the public, especially against the backdrop of his extensive criminal\n\nhistory.\u201d   Id.   The State concludes that Monroe\u2019s \u201ccriminal history of similar offenses,\n\ncombined with his rejection of rehabilitative resources on bond, demonstrated that he\n\ncontinued to pose a danger to the public, such that consecutive sentences were necessary\n\nto protect the public from future crime by him.\u201d Id. at p. 5-6.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court stated that it had reviewed the pre-\n\nsentence investigation report, statements of counsel, and statements of Monroe. The court\n\nexplained in detail why it had decided to impose consecutive prison sentences, including\n\ngoing through some of Monroe\u2019s lengthy criminal history and how his recent criminal actions\n\nhad escalated the risk of harm to the public. The court then stated that (1) consecutive\n\nsentencing was necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish Monroe;\n\n(2) consecutive sentences were not disproportionate to the seriousness of the conduct and\n\ndanger that Monroe poses to the public; and (3) Monroe\u2019s history of criminal conduct\n\ndemonstrated that consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the public from future\n\ncrime by Monroe. The trial court\u2019s findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) were also included in\n\nthe judgment entry.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Based on our review of the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s\n\nconsecutive-sentence findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) were clearly and convincingly\n\nunsupported by the record.

WILDER, Attorney for Appellant\nKARA N. RICHTER, Attorney for Appellee\n\n\nLEWIS, J.\n\n        {\u00b6 1} Defendant-Appellant Randolph Monroe appeals from his convictions in the\n\nChampaign County Common Pleas Court following his guilty pleas.           For the following\n\nreasons, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n\n\n   I.       Course of Proceedings\n\n        {\u00b6 1} On July 1, 2024, in Champaign C.P. No. 2024 CR 086, Monroe was indicted by\n\na Champaign County grand jury on two counts of aggravated possession of drugs, fifth-\n\ndegree felonies in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). These offenses related to events that\n\noccurred on June 23, 2024.\n\n        {\u00b6 2} On October 7, 2024, in Champaign C.P. No. 2024 CR 144, Monroe was indicted\n\nby a Champaign County grand jury on two counts of aggravated possession of drugs, fifth-\n\ndegree felonies in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). These offenses related to events that\n\noccurred on September 22, 2024. Monroe pleaded not guilty in both of his criminal cases.\n\n        {\u00b6 3} On November 7, 2024, the trial court issued a journal entry finding bond\n\nviolations in both of Monroe\u2019s criminal cases after he admitted to using illegal controlled\n\nsubstances in October and November 2024 and to failing to attend TCN Intensive Outpatient\n\ntreatment.\n\n        {\u00b6 4} On November 18, 2024, the State filed a motion to revoke bond in both cases\n\ndue to Monroe\u2019s alleged failure to be a law-abiding citizen as required in his conditions of\n\nbond. According to the State, Monroe had been charged with driving under suspension in\n\n                                              2\n\fa Champaign County Municipal Court case and failed to appear for his scheduled court\n\nhearing.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} On December 2, 2024, the State filed a bill of information in Case No. 2024 CR\n\n144 charging Monroe with one count of operating a vehicle while under the influence of a\n\nlisted controlled substance (\u201cOVI\u201d), a first-degree misdemeanor in violation of\n\nR.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(j). Monroe pleaded not guilty to this additional count.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} On December 3, 2024, the trial court issued an entry finding additional bond\n\nviolations in Monroe\u2019s two criminal cases based on his admissions that he drove under\n\nsuspension in November 2024 and tested positive for alcohol in December 2024.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} On December 23, 2024, the trial court found Monroe guilty of additional bond\n\nviolations after he admitted to testing positive for cocaine and alcohol and failing to follow\n\nan order of pretrial services.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} Monroe and the State entered into a plea agreement to resolve Case Nos. 2024\n\nCR 086 and 2024 CR 144. In Case No. 2024 CR 144, he pleaded guilty to OVI and to one\n\ncount of aggravated possession of drugs, and in Case No. 2024 CR 086, he pleaded guilty\n\nto one count of aggravated possession of drugs. In return for Monroe\u2019s guilty pleas, the\n\nState agreed to request dismissal of the remaining counts of aggravated possession of drugs\n\nin Case Nos. 2024 CR 086 and 2024 CR 144. The trial court accepted Monroe\u2019s guilty\n\npleas and found him guilty of two counts of aggravated possession of drugs and one count\n\nof OVI. The court dismissed the remaining counts in his two criminal cases.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} On January 31, 2025, following a sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced\n\nMonroe to 12 months in prison in Case No. 2024 CR 086 and to 12 months in prison for\n\naggravated possession of drugs and 150 days in jail for OVI in Case No. 2024 CR 144. The\n\ncourt ran the sentences in Case No. 2024 CR 144 concurrently with each other but\n\n\n                                              3\n\fconsecutive to the sentence in Case No. 2024 CR 086, for a total prison sentence of\n\n24 months.      In imposing consecutive sentences, the trial court found that consecutive\n\nsentencing was necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish Monroe and\n\nthat consecutive sentences were not disproportionate to the seriousness of Monroe\u2019s\n\nconduct and to the danger Monroe poses to the public. R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). The court\n\nalso found that Monroe\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrated that consecutive\n\nsentences were necessary to protect the public from future crime by Monroe.\n\nR.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(c). The court ordered Monroe to pay court costs and fines.\n\n         {\u00b6 10} Monroe timely appealed.\n\n\n   II.      Assignment of Error\n\n         {\u00b6 11} Monroe\u2019s assignment of error states:\n\n         The record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding of a consecutive sentence.\n\n         {\u00b6 12} In reviewing felony sentences, appellate courts must apply the standard of\n\nreview set forth in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).

He further contends that the imposition of consecutive prison\n\nsentences for two fifth-degree felony possession convictions was disproportionate to the\n\nseriousness of his conduct and the danger he posed to the public. According to Monroe,\n\nhe clearly \u201chad an issue staying clean. There is no evidence that he posed a danger to the\n\npublic. He posed a danger to himself by failing to remain drug-free. His acts of possessing\n\ndrugs were not posing a danger to the public.\u201d Id. at p. 4-5.\n\n      {\u00b6 16} The State responds that the record provided a substantial basis for the\n\nimposition of consecutive prison sentences. According to the State, the following facts\n\nsupported the consecutive prison sentences:        Monroe\u2019s two felony drug possession\n\noffenses arose from two separate traffic stops approximately three months apart; his driver\u2019s\n\nlicense was suspended at the time of both traffic stops; he admitted to recent drinking and\n\ndrug use and had drug paraphernalia inside the vehicle; his conviction for OVI is an\n\n\n                                             6\n\finherently dangerous crime that places the public at risk of harm; he had a number of bond\n\nviolations; he had a history of juvenile adjudications; and as an adult, he had a lengthy felony\n\nhistory and two prior OVI convictions. Appellee\u2019s Brief, p. 5. The State contends that the\n\ncircumstances surrounding Monroe\u2019s two separate drug possession cases \u201cindicate that\n\nconsecutive sentences were not disproportionate to the seriousness of his conduct and\n\ndanger he posed to the public, especially against the backdrop of his extensive criminal\n\nhistory.\u201d   Id.   The State concludes that Monroe\u2019s \u201ccriminal history of similar offenses,\n\ncombined with his rejection of rehabilitative resources on bond, demonstrated that he\n\ncontinued to pose a danger to the public, such that consecutive sentences were necessary\n\nto protect the public from future crime by him.\u201d Id. at p. 5-6.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court stated that it had reviewed the pre-\n\nsentence investigation report, statements of counsel, and statements of Monroe. The court\n\nexplained in detail why it had decided to impose consecutive prison sentences, including\n\ngoing through some of Monroe\u2019s lengthy criminal history and how his recent criminal actions\n\nhad escalated the risk of harm to the public. The court then stated that (1) consecutive\n\nsentencing was necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish Monroe;\n\n(2) consecutive sentences were not disproportionate to the seriousness of the conduct and\n\ndanger that Monroe poses to the public; and (3) Monroe\u2019s history of criminal conduct\n\ndemonstrated that consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the public from future\n\ncrime by Monroe. The trial court\u2019s findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) were also included in\n\nthe judgment entry.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Based on our review of the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s\n\nconsecutive-sentence findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) were clearly and convincingly\n\nunsupported by the record. Therefore, Monroe\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n                                               7\n\f   III.

No. 2025-CA-14\n\n\nCHRISTOPHER BAZELEY, Attorney for Appellant\nJESSICA STILTNER, Attorney for Appellee\n\n\nEPLEY, P.J.\n\n       {\u00b6 1} Defendant-Appellant Daniel O\u2019Neal appeals from his conviction in Miami County\n\nMunicipal Court Case No. 2025 CRB 00060 after he pled guilty to three counts of misuse of\n\ncredit cards (first-degree misdemeanors) and was sentenced to two consecutive 180-day\n\njail terms. Because the trial court failed to calculate O\u2019Neal\u2019s jail-time credit at his sentencing,\n\nwe reverse in part and remand for the limited purpose of resentencing to calculate jail-time\n\ncredit. In all other respects, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n       I.     Facts and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b6 2} In 2022 and 2023, O\u2019Neal battled drug addiction and overdosed multiple times,\n\nresulting in two misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges (22 CRB 02907; 22 CRB 03035)\n\nand one disorderly intoxication charge (23 CRB 03155). In early 2025, he stole a credit card\n\nfrom an acquaintance and used it to purchase small items from local stores. This conduct\n\nled to five counts of misuse of credit cards (25 CRB 00060), all first-degree misdemeanors,\n\nand a felony theft charge (which is not a part of this appeal).\n\n       {\u00b6 3} On February 19, 2025, O\u2019Neal agreed to plead guilty to three of the misuse of\n\ncredit card counts in exchange for the dismissal of the other two. He also pleaded guilty to\n\nthe 2022 disorderly conduct and 2023 disorderly intoxication charges. As pertinent to this\n\nappeal, the court imposed consecutive 180-day jail terms on two of the misuse of credit card\n\ncharges and \u201czero days jail\u201d on the other. The court did not address any jail-time credit that\n\nO\u2019Neal may have accumulated.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f       {\u00b6 4} O\u2019Neal has filed a timely appeal from each judgment of conviction but assigns\n\nerror in the misuse of credit cards case only.\n\n       II.    Voluntariness of Plea\n\n       {\u00b6 5} In his first assignment of error, O\u2019Neal argues that his plea was not made in a\n\nknowing, intelligent, and voluntary manner because he was not informed of the penalties he\n\ncould receive if found guilty of the offenses.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} \u201cWhen a defendant enters a plea in a criminal case, the plea must be made\n\nknowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.\u201d State v. Engle, 74 Ohio St.3d 525, 527 (1996). A\n\nplea that is not made in that manner is invalid. State v. Bishop, 2018-Ohio-5132, \u00b6 10, citing\n\nState v. Clark, 2008-Ohio-3748, \u00b6 25. Compliance with Crim.R. 11 \u201c\u2018ensures an adequate\n\nrecord on review by requiring the trial court to personally inform the defendant of his rights\n\nand the consequences of his plea and determine if the plea is understandingly and\n\nvoluntarily made.\u2019\u201d State v. Dangler, 2020-Ohio-2765, \u00b6 11, quoting State v. Stone, 43 Ohio\n\nSt.2d 163, 168 (1975).\n\n       {\u00b6 7} \u201cCrim.R. 11 outlines the procedures courts follow when accepting pleas, and\n\nthose procedures vary depending on whether the offense is a misdemeanor that is a petty\n\noffense, a misdemeanor that is a serious offense, or a felony.\u201d State v. Dean, 2022-Ohio-\n\n2803, \u00b6 6 (2d Dist.), citing State v. Howard, 2018-Ohio-5160, \u00b6 17 (2d Dist.). A \u201cserious\n\noffense\u201d is defined as \u201cany felony, and any misdemeanor for which the penalty prescribed\n\nby law includes confinement for more than six months.\u201d Crim.R. 2(C). A \u201cpetty offense,\u201d on\n\nthe other hand, is \u201ca misdemeanor other than a serious offense.\u201d Crim.R. 2(D); State v. Tobe,\n\n2025-Ohio-489, \u00b6 8 (2d Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b6 8} For a petty offense, a trial court is required to comply with Crim.R. 11(E) during\n\nthe plea hearing. Crim.R. 11(E) provides that the court cannot accept a plea \u201cwithout first\n\n\n                                                 3\n\finforming the defendant of the effect of the plea of guilty, no contest, and not guilty.\u201d The\n\neffect of a guilty plea \u201cis a complete admission of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d Crim.R. 11(B)(1).\n\nTherefore, to satisfy the requirement of informing the defendant of \u201cthe effect of the plea\u201d in\n\ncases involving a misdemeanor petty offense, the court is required to inform him or her that\n\nthe plea is a complete admission of guilt. State v. Jones, 2007-Ohio-6093, \u00b6 20. The\n\ninformation may be provided either orally or in writing. Id. at \u00b6 51.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} While O\u2019Neal correctly cites to Crim.R. 11(E) for the proposition that the trial\n\ncourt must inform the defendant of the effect of his plea, he goes on to cite several Ohio\n\nappellate courts which require more for petty offenses \u2013 an advisement of the potential\n\npenalties if found guilty. A recitation of the maximum penalty is certainly required for felony\n\npleas, but that is not the case for petty-offense misdemeanors, and we reject O\u2019Neal\u2019s\n\nposition. Our view is in line with the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Jones, which states:\n\n\u201c[W]e hold that in accepting a plea to a misdemeanor involving a petty offense, a trial court\n\nis required to inform the defendant only of the effect of the specific plea being entered.\u201d\n\n(Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 20; Tobe at \u00b6 11 (\u201c[B]ecause Tobe entered a guilty plea [to a\n\npetty offense], the trial court was only required to inform her of the effect of a guilty plea, i.e.,\n\nthat it was a complete admission of guilt.\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b6 10} At the plea hearing in this case, the trial court told O\u2019Neal that \u201ca guilty plea is\n\na complete admission of guilt.\u201d Tr. p. 4. In doing so, it complied with Crim.R. 11(E) and the\n\nOhio Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in Jones. Accordingly, O\u2019Neal\u2019s first assignment of\n\nerror is overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f       III.    Jail-Time Credit\n\n       {\u00b6 11} In his second assignment of error, O\u2019Neal contends that the trial court erred\n\nwhen it failed to calculate the amount of jail-time credit to which he was entitled. The State\n\nagrees.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} \u201cWhether a defendant is convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor offense,\n\nunder Ohio law, both are afforded jail-time credit for time served.\u201d State v. Jack, 2024-Ohio-\n\n5594, \u00b6 16 (2d Dist.), quoting Bratenahl v. Eldridge, 2021-Ohio-1083, \u00b6 9 (8th Dist.). The\n\nconcept is codified in R.C. 2949.08 for offenders sentenced to jail. The statute requires a\n\nsentence to be reduced by the \u201ctotal number of days an offender was confined for any reason\n\narising out of the offense for which the offender was convicted and sentenced[.]\u201d\n\n2949.08(C)(1).\n\n       {\u00b6 13} \u201c[W]hen a trial court sentences a person convicted of a misdemeanor to a jail\n\nterm, it is required to \u2018specify the total number of days, if any, that the person was confined\n\nfor any reason arising out of the offense for which the person was convicted and sentenced\u2019\n\nso that the person\u2019s sentence is appropriately reduced.\u201d State v. Roweton, 2025-Ohio-2027,\n\n\u00b6 25 (2d Dist.), citing R.C. 2949.08(B), (C). The terms of the statute are mandatory, and the\n\ntrial court\u2019s failure to calculate the jail-time credit and include it in the body of the judgment\n\nentry is plain error. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 14} Both parties agree (and the record confirms) that the trial court failed to make\n\nany findings of jail-time credit at the sentencing hearing or in the judgment entry. The court\n\nthus committed plain error, and O\u2019Neal\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.\n\n       IV.     Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b6 15} Because it failed to address the issue of jail-time credit, the trial court\u2019s\n\njudgment as to sentence in Case No. 2025 CRB 00060 is reversed in part and remanded to\n\n\n                                                5\n\fcalculate the jail-time credit to which O\u2019Neal is entitled. The judgments of the trial court are\n\naffirmed in all other respects.\n\n                                       .............\n\nLEWIS, J., and HANSEMAN, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">[Cite as State v.

Our view is in line with the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Jones, which states:\n\n\u201c[W]e hold that in accepting a plea to a misdemeanor involving a petty offense, a trial court\n\nis required to inform the defendant only of the effect of the specific plea being entered.\u201d\n\n(Emphasis added.)

Mother and Father, however, do not have an amicable relationship. The two\n\nhave made several motions over the course of D.B.\u2019s life to modify parenting time and\n\nto ask the court to find each other in contempt.\n\n        {\u00b62}     In this current dispute, Mother filed a motion in January of 2025, to\n\nmodify parenting time. The juvenile court granted Mother\u2019s motion, but it did so by\n\nextending Father\u2019s parenting time. Unsatisfied with more time for Father, Mother\n\nnow appeals pro se. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ntrial court granting Father more parenting time.\n\n                          I. Factual and Procedural History\n\n        {\u00b63}     When D.B. was born, his parents had already separated. Mother has\n\nbeen the residential parent for all D.B.\u2019s life. Mother and Father have returned to the\n\njuvenile court attempting to find a balance in time that works for all parties.\n\n        {\u00b64}     In 2019, Mother and Father returned to the trial court to amend\n\nparenting time. The trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and ordered\n\n\u201cFather shall have the following parenting time: Every other week from after school\n\non Thursday until before school Monday.\u201d The order additionally specified holiday\n\ntime and gave each parent extended parenting time during school breaks. Until recent\n\nyears, Father was very active in D.B.\u2019s life and wanted more opportunities to spend\n\ntime with him.\n\n        {\u00b65}     Before the 2019 order, Mother and Father had been in court frequently,\n\nbut there was a stretch where the schedule seemed to be working without court\n\nintervention. In 2024, Mother filed the next motion to modify parenting time. Mother\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nmade this motion because Father\u2019s partner passed away in 2022 while D.B. was in the\n\nhome. After the death, Father struggled with his mental health and was not as present\n\nwith D.B. as he previously had been. Father did not exercise his parenting time\n\nconsistently and he was detached from both D.B. and Mother.\n\n       {\u00b66}   In 2024, the trial court granted Mother\u2019s motion to modify and issued a\n\nnew schedule replacing the one from 2019. The court was concerned with Father\u2019s\n\nmental stability, his employment status, and the unknown circumstances of his\n\npartner\u2019s death. The court ordered the new schedule to be \u201cevery other Sunday . . .\n\nfrom 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\u201d The court weighed all appropriate factors and found\n\nthis to be in the best interest of the child. Father admitted that he was not as present\n\nin D.B.\u2019s life at this time and that he was struggling with depression. Going forward,\n\nhe intended to be more present and consistent.\n\n       {\u00b67}   In 2025, Mother filed a motion to modify parental time, have Father\n\ncomply with the last order as written, and keep Father from accessing D.B.\u2019s school\n\nrecords. The trial court entered its order in April. It granted Mother\u2019s motion to\n\nmodify, but not in the way she had hoped. The court granted more time to Father\n\nbecause Father showed improvement since the 2024 order. The new order gave Father\n\n\u201cparenting time at least one day each weekend\u201d from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.\n\nAdditionally, D.B. \u201cshall have the ability to choose whether he sees Father during the\n\nweekend or not,\u201d and D.B. can stay overnight if Father is home. Mother timely\n\nappealed this order asserting one assignment of error.\n\n                                    II. Analysis\n\n       {\u00b68}   Mother argues that the trial court erred by granting additional\n\nparenting time to Father without Father demonstrating stability, positive parenting,\n\nor consistency. She asserts that because the trial court placed no burden of proof on\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nFather to demonstrate his willingness to provide stability, the trial court should not\n\nhave granted him more parenting time.\n\n       {\u00b69}    Essentially, Mother\u2019s assignment of error is that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion in granting her January 30, 2025 motion to modify parenting time by\n\nextending Father\u2019s parenting time. See Souders v. Souders, 2022-Ohio-1953, \u00b6 6 (1st\n\nDist.); Helms v. Helms, 2017-Ohio-2780, \u00b6 15 (2d Dist.) (\u201cFrom our reading of\n\n[appellant\u2019s] brief, it appears that she intended to assert the argument that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in granting [extended] parenting time to Helms.\u201d). Mother\n\nargues that Father has not been active in D.B.\u2019s life since his partner passed away in\n\n2022. She argues that he is an addict and cannot provide a safe home for D.B.\n\n       {\u00b610} However, Mother failed to cause the proper transcripts to be included\n\nin the record under App.R. 9. Therefore, \u201cthis court must presume the regularity of\n\nthe proceedings.\u201d Ndiathe v. Ndiath, 2025-Ohio-4828, \u00b6 13 (1st Dist.); see Treasurer\n\nv. Scott, 2022-Ohio-1467, \u00b6 16 (1st Dist.), quoting Knapp v. Edwards Laboratories, 61\n\nOhio St.2d 197, 199 (1980) (\u201c\u2018When portions of the transcript necessary for resolution\n\nof assigned errors are omitted from the record, the reviewing court has nothing to pass\n\nupon and thus, as to those assigned errors, the court has no choice but to presume the\n\nvalidity of the lower court\u2019s proceedings, and affirm.\u2019\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the\n\nlower court\u2019s judgment. Id.\n\n       {\u00b611} Regardless of the lack of transcript, \u201c[d]ecisions concerning child-\n\ncustody matters rest within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d In re A.C., 2019-\n\nOhio-2891, \u00b6 12 (1st Dist.), citing Miller v. Miller, 37 Ohio St.3d 71 (1988). In the court\n\nbelow, \u201c[t]he judge, acting as the trier of fact, is in the best position to observe the\n\nwitnesses, weigh evidence and evaluate testimony.\u201d Id., citing In re Brown, 98 Ohio\n\nApp.3d 337 (3d Dist. 1994). On review, \u201cwe must not substitute our judgment for that\n\n\n                                            5\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nof the trial court absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id., citing Miller at 74. Because of\n\nthis, \u201c[w]e will not reverse a trial court\u2019s judgment that is supported by competent,\n\ncredible evidence.\u201d Id., citing Bechtol v. Bechtol, 49 Ohio St.3d 21, 23 (1990). Because\n\nthere is no transcript, we cannot review whether there was competent, credible\n\nevidence.\n\n       {\u00b612} Courts follow R.C. 3109.051 when deciding whether to modify a\n\nparenting time schedule. Helms, 2017-Ohio-2780, at \u00b6 17 (2d Dist.), citing Braatz v.\n\nBraatz, 85 Ohio St.3d 40 (1999), paragraph one of the syllabus. When revising a\n\nparenting time schedule, the trial court considers the factors set forth in R.C. 3109.051\n\nand determines a schedule \u201cthat is in the best interest of the child.\u201d Id. at paragraph\n\ntwo of the syllabus. These factors include the prior interaction and relationship of the\n\nchild with the child\u2019s parents; the geographical location of the residence of each parent\n\nand the distance between those residences; the child\u2019s and parents\u2019 available time; the\n\nage of the child; the child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community; interviews\n\nwith the child; the health and safety of the child; amount of time available for the child\n\nto spend with siblings; the mental and physical health of all parties; each parent\u2019s\n\nwillingness to reschedule missed parenting time and to facilitate the other parent\u2019s\n\nparenting time rights; one parent\u2019s denial of the other parent\u2019s right to parenting time;\n\nand any other factor in the best interest of the child. Helms at \u00b6 17, citing R.C.\n\n3109.051(D).\n\n       {\u00b613} In Helms, the Second District affirmed the lower court\u2019s modification to\n\nparenting time where the lower court went through the relevant factors and made\n\nfactual findings supporting its decision. Id. at \u00b6 19. Though the mother moved to\n\nmodify the parenting time, the court there expanded the father\u2019s parenting time\n\nbecause it was \u201cin the son\u2019s best interest to have that parenting time\u201d after the father\n\n\n                                            6\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nshowed improved behaviors. Id. at \u00b6 18.\n\n       {\u00b614} In the current case, the lower court went through each factor in R.C.\n\n3109.051(D) and determined \u201cFather has attempted to be part of the child\u2019s life and\n\nthat he does care about the child.\u201d The court also noted concern with Father\u2019s past\n\nand acknowledged that Father withdrew \u201cfrom his child\u2019s life for an extended period\n\nof time,\u201d but Father now was presenting positive behaviors. The record reflects the\n\ntrial court\u2019s considerations to determine what is best for D.B. On the record before us,\n\nwe cannot say it was an abuse of discretion to allow D.B. the opportunity to see Father\n\nwhen D.B. is available.\n\n       {\u00b615} Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s assignment of error.\n\n                                  III.

Mother and Father, however, do not have an amicable relationship. The two\n\nhave made several motions over the course of D.B.\u2019s life to modify parenting time and\n\nto ask the court to find each other in contempt.\n\n        {\u00b62}     In this current dispute, Mother filed a motion in January of 2025, to\n\nmodify parenting time. The juvenile court granted Mother\u2019s motion, but it did so by\n\nextending Father\u2019s parenting time. Unsatisfied with more time for Father, Mother\n\nnow appeals pro se. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ntrial court granting Father more parenting time.\n\n                          I. Factual and Procedural History\n\n        {\u00b63}     When D.B. was born, his parents had already separated. Mother has\n\nbeen the residential parent for all D.B.\u2019s life. Mother and Father have returned to the\n\njuvenile court attempting to find a balance in time that works for all parties.\n\n        {\u00b64}     In 2019, Mother and Father returned to the trial court to amend\n\nparenting time. The trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and ordered\n\n\u201cFather shall have the following parenting time: Every other week from after school\n\non Thursday until before school Monday.\u201d The order additionally specified holiday\n\ntime and gave each parent extended parenting time during school breaks. Until recent\n\nyears, Father was very active in D.B.\u2019s life and wanted more opportunities to spend\n\ntime with him.\n\n        {\u00b65}     Before the 2019 order, Mother and Father had been in court frequently,\n\nbut there was a stretch where the schedule seemed to be working without court\n\nintervention. In 2024, Mother filed the next motion to modify parenting time. Mother\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nmade this motion because Father\u2019s partner passed away in 2022 while D.B. was in the\n\nhome. After the death, Father struggled with his mental health and was not as present\n\nwith D.B. as he previously had been. Father did not exercise his parenting time\n\nconsistently and he was detached from both D.B. and Mother.\n\n       {\u00b66}   In 2024, the trial court granted Mother\u2019s motion to modify and issued a\n\nnew schedule replacing the one from 2019. The court was concerned with Father\u2019s\n\nmental stability, his employment status, and the unknown circumstances of his\n\npartner\u2019s death. The court ordered the new schedule to be \u201cevery other Sunday . . .\n\nfrom 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\u201d The court weighed all appropriate factors and found\n\nthis to be in the best interest of the child. Father admitted that he was not as present\n\nin D.B.\u2019s life at this time and that he was struggling with depression. Going forward,\n\nhe intended to be more present and consistent.\n\n       {\u00b67}   In 2025, Mother filed a motion to modify parental time, have Father\n\ncomply with the last order as written, and keep Father from accessing D.B.\u2019s school\n\nrecords. The trial court entered its order in April. It granted Mother\u2019s motion to\n\nmodify, but not in the way she had hoped. The court granted more time to Father\n\nbecause Father showed improvement since the 2024 order. The new order gave Father\n\n\u201cparenting time at least one day each weekend\u201d from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.\n\nAdditionally, D.B. \u201cshall have the ability to choose whether he sees Father during the\n\nweekend or not,\u201d and D.B. can stay overnight if Father is home. Mother timely\n\nappealed this order asserting one assignment of error.\n\n                                    II. Analysis\n\n       {\u00b68}   Mother argues that the trial court erred by granting additional\n\nparenting time to Father without Father demonstrating stability, positive parenting,\n\nor consistency. She asserts that because the trial court placed no burden of proof on\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nFather to demonstrate his willingness to provide stability, the trial court should not\n\nhave granted him more parenting time.\n\n       {\u00b69}    Essentially, Mother\u2019s assignment of error is that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion in granting her January 30, 2025 motion to modify parenting time by\n\nextending Father\u2019s parenting time.

Horton, 2025-Ohio-5252.]\n\n\nMOORE, Judge.\n\n        {\u00b61}     Plaintiff-appellant Nanette Kelley appeals the judgment of the\n\nHamilton County Court of Common Pleas after a jury found co-defendants and co-\n\nappellees Dr. Edward S. Horton, Jr., M.D., Dr. Zainab P. Contractor, M.D., Tristate\n\nIMG, Inc., and several TriHealth subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cdefendants\u201d), had not\n\ncommitted medical malpractice. During the course of the trial below, Kelley argued\n\nthat defendants\u2019 medical malpractice caused Kelley to lose vision in her right eye.\n\n        {\u00b62}     Kelley now raises two assignments of error. First, Kelley alleges the\n\ncourt erred in allowing defendants to cross-examine one of Kelley\u2019s witnesses with a\n\npublication under the learned-treatise exception without first requiring defendants to\n\nlay a proper foundation. Second, Kelley argues the court\u2019s jury instructions on remote,\n\nintervening, and superseding causation were legally inaccurate and prejudiced her.\n\n        {\u00b63}     For the reasons set forth below, the trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                      I. Factual History\n\n        {\u00b64}     On January 10, 2023, Kelley filed a complaint against defendants,\n\nalleging claims for medical malpractice. From September 26 through October 4, 2024,\n\nthe court held a seven-day jury trial.\n\n        {\u00b65}     In October 2019, Kelley had her first visit with defendant Dr.\n\nContractor, a neurologist and headache specialist at TriHealth Hospital. On Kelley\u2019s\n\ndiagnostic form, Kelley stated that she had a 30-year history of headaches, that the\n\nnumber of headache days she experienced monthly increased from one to three and\n\nthen from three to five, that the location of her headaches had recently shifted from\n\nthe left to right side of her head, and that her right temple would become sore to the\n\ntouch during headache flareups. Material to this appeal, Kelley was 50 years old when\n\nshe visited with Dr. Contractor and had previously been diagnosed with Chronic\n\f                     OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nKidney Disease in 2016.\n\n       {\u00b66}    At the close of the visit, Dr. Contractor ordered a magnetic resonance\n\nimaging (\u201cMRI\u201d) scan of Kelley\u2019s brain without intravenous (\u201cIV\u201d) fluid contrast. Dr.\n\nContractor explained she normally orders a MRI scan without IV contrast to establish\n\na baseline, and that she would request a scan with IV contrast if she had reason to\n\nbelieve a tumor was present. In her deposition, Dr. Contractor stated that because of\n\nKelley\u2019s history of Chronic Kidney Disease, an MRI scan without contrast was\n\nappropriate for initial screening purposes.\n\n       {\u00b67}    On December 6, 2019, Kelley underwent the MRI scan. Dr. Contractor\u2019s\n\nnotes reviewing the scan identified a few \u201cwhite matter\u201d abnormalities, but noted that\n\nthese were consistent with patients of Kelley\u2019s age, and that it was unlikely that these\n\nwere the cause of Kelley\u2019s headaches. Dr. Contractor believed that these abnormalities\n\nwere attributable to Kelley\u2019s age or her history of Chronic Kidney Disease. At the close\n\nof the visit, Dr. Contractor scheduled a follow-up visit with Kelley in December 2020.\n\n       {\u00b68}    Defendant Dr. Horton, a radiologist, also testified that he interpreted\n\nKelley\u2019s scans. Dr. Horton\u2019s report interpreting the 2019 MRI scan concluded that\n\nthere were no significant abnormalities, such as tumors or hemorrhaging present.\n\n       {\u00b69}    Despite Dr. Contractor\u2019s care plan, Kelley never returned for her follow-\n\nup. Kelley explained that she was reluctant to complete her follow-up with Dr.\n\nContractor, since this was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Kelley\n\ntestified that she continued to work with her primary-care provider throughout 2020\n\nand most of 2021 and that her symptoms had not worsened or changed. However, in\n\nDecember 2021, Kelley\u2019s vision in her right eye abruptly worsened, resulting in near\n\ntotal vision loss.\n\n       {\u00b610} After Kelley\u2019s ophthalmologist could not resolve the issue, she was\n\n\n                                           6\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nreferred to a neurologist and underwent MRI scans with and without contrast. Dr.\n\nHorton again interpreted Kelley\u2019s MRI, and concluded that Kelley had a meningioma\n\nthat had encompassed her right optical nerve.1 Despite surgery and radiation\n\ntreatments, Kelley\u2019s vision in her right eye could not be restored. Kelley recalled that\n\nwhen speaking with her neurosurgeon and radiologist she learned that the\n\nmeningioma was identifiable in her 2019 MRI scan.\n\n       {\u00b611} Dr. Horton testified that he produced a report for both of Kelley\u2019s MRI\n\nscans. Dr. Horton conceded that when comparing the 2022 scan with the 2019 scan,\n\nhe could observe a tumor present within the initial scan. However, Dr. Horton argued\n\nthat his initial interpretation did not breach the standard of care. Dr. Horton explained\n\nthat the tumor was only detectable with the benefit of hindsight, and that many of the\n\nabnormalities that would indicate the presence of a tumor were too subtle for Dr.\n\nHorton to have conclusively determined the presence of a meningioma near Kelley\u2019s\n\noptic nerve.\n\n       {\u00b612} In addition to Kelley, Dr. Contractor, and Dr. Horton, the court heard\n\ntestimony from several experts. On whether Dr. Contractor breached the standard of\n\ncare, the parties called competing neurologists. Kelley introduced Dr. Mankowski,\n\nwhile defendants called Dr. Merkler. On whether Dr. Horton breached the standard of\n\ncare, the parties called competing radiologists. Kelley relied upon Dr. Berger, while\n\ndefendants called Dr. Cizek. Defendants also called Dr. Volpe, a neuro-opthamologist,\n\nwho testified that detection of the tumor in 2019-2020 would not have prevented\n\nKelley from losing her vision in 2021.\n\n\n\n1 A meningioma is a tumor that grows from the membranes that surround the brain and spine, and\n\nmay damage nerves near the brain as the tumor grows. See Mayo Clinic, Meningioma,\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/meningioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20355643\n(accessed Nov. 6, 2025) [https://perma.cc/QQ3Y-AEJH].\n\n\n                                              7\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b613} Material to this appeal, Dr. Mankowski testified that given Kelley\u2019s\n\nsymptoms, Dr. Contractor\u2019s decision to order an MRI scan without IV contrast\n\nbreached the standard of care. During cross-examination, Dr. Mankowski was asked\n\nif he was aware of a guideline from the American College of Radiology (\u201cACR\u201d), the\n\nACR appropriateness criteria for headaches, and whether neurologists were involved\n\nin developing the appropriateness criteria. Dr. Mankowski answered that he was\n\ngenerally aware of all three. When asked whether Dr. Mankowski was \u201caware that the\n\nAmerican College of Radiology --,\u201d counsel for Kelley objected.\n\n       {\u00b614} The parties discussed the objection in chambers. Kelley emphasized two\n\npoints, that Dr. Mankowski was not a radiologist and therefore the reference to the\n\nACR was irrelevant, and that defendants failed to share the document in advance of\n\ntrial. At no point during this initial objection did Kelley contend that the ACR guideline\n\nwas inadmissible hearsay, argue that defendants failed to set forth the proper\n\nfoundation, or assert that the ACR guideline failed to qualify as a learned treatise. The\n\ncourt overruled Kelley\u2019s objection and permitted the defense to continue its line of\n\nquestioning. After recommencing cross-examination, counsel asked Dr. Mankowski\n\nwhether he was aware that the ACR\u2019s appropriateness criteria considered an MRI\n\nwithout IV contrast appropriate, to which Dr. Mankowski answered that he was not\n\naware. Once the parties completed their respective examinations, the court dismissed\n\nDr. Mankowski. At the start of the proceedings the next day, Kelley revisited her\n\nobjection and raised a hearsay objection, arguing that the ACR guideline was not\n\nadmissible under the learned-treatise hearsay exception under Evid.R. 803(18).\n\nAgain, the court overruled Kelley\u2019s objection.\n\n       {\u00b615} During the parties\u2019 charging conference, which took place before the\n\ndefense completed its case and the parties made their closing arguments, the parties\n\n\n                                            8\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\ndiscussed the proposed jury instructions. Kelley objected that the \u201cremote,\n\nintervening, and superseding cause\u201d language was inapplicable because defendants\n\nhad failed to introduce any evidence to demonstrate that Kelley was culpable for her\n\ninjuries. Defendants stated that they were not intending to argue that Kelley was\n\nnegligent. Instead, the defendants argued that the intervening and superseding\n\nlanguage must stay in, in case the jury found for Kelley, since the defendants would\n\nneed to assess if intervening conduct would adjust the damages award. Despite\n\nobjecting, Kelley ultimately agreed.\n\n       {\u00b616} However, during closing arguments, defendants repeatedly referenced\n\nthat Kelley\u2019s actions lead to the late discovery of the tumor. Defendants argued that\n\nKelley chose not to come back to Dr. Contractor for a follow-up visit, and that \u201cyou\n\ncan\u2019t blame a physician if a patient chooses not to follow up.\u201d Despite defendants\u2019\n\nclosing arguments, at no point did Kelley request another opportunity to discuss the\n\njury instructions, nor did she object to defendants\u2019 closing remarks or renew her\n\nobjection to the jury instructions.\n\n       {\u00b617}   This appeal followed.\n\n                                       II. Analysis\n\n       {\u00b618} Kelley raises two assignments of error on appeal, the first of which\n\nargues the court erred in admitting testimony related to the ACR guideline, and the\n\nsecond of which challenges the jury instructions.\n\n                      A. Admission of a Learned Treatise\n\n       {\u00b619} A trial court wields broad discretion in the admission of evidence, and\n\nits judgment shall not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Worley v. Durrani,\n\n2025-Ohio-2245, \u00b6 15 (1st Dist.); see In re K.M., 2024-Ohio-2278, \u00b6 11 (1st Dist.), citing\n\nHSBC Bank, USA, Natl. Assn. v. Gill, 2019-Ohio-2814, \u00b6 1-5 (1st Dist.) (recognizing\n\n\n                                            9\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nthat the standard of review for hearsay determinations differs between Ohio appellate\n\ndistricts, but concluding that this court\u2019s prior holdings require that we analyze the\n\nalleged improper admission of hearsay under Evid.R. 803 for an abuse of discretion).\n\n       {\u00b620} Under Evid.R. 803, hearsay evidence is generally inadmissible, unless a\n\nhearsay exception applies. One such exception, under Evid.R. 803(18), admission as a\n\nlearned treatise, is material to this appeal. Evid.R. 803(18) provides,\n\n               Learned Treatises. To the extent called to the attention of an\n\n       expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert\n\n       witness in direct examination, statements contained in published\n\n       treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of history, medicine, or\n\n       other science or art, established as a reliable authority by the testimony\n\n       or admission of the witness or by other expert testimony or by judicial\n\n       notice. If admitted, the statements may be read into evidence but may\n\n       not be received as exhibits.\n\n       {\u00b621} The use of a learned treatise is appropriate for the purposes of\n\nimpeachment upon establishing that the authority referenced is reliable. Bogdanov v.\n\nAhres, 2021-Ohio-1322, \u00b6 8 (1st Dist.), citing Bradley v. Ohio Dept. of Transp., 2012-\n\nOhio-451, \u00b6 23 (10th Dist.) (stating an expert need only testify that a learned treatise\n\nis a reliable authority for a court to admit its content into the record).\n\n       {\u00b622} Should a party take issue with a court\u2019s admission of evidence, the party\n\nmust set forth in a timely manner \u201cthe specific ground of objection, if the specific\n\nground is not apparent from the context\u201d in which the objection was raised. Evid.R.\n\n103(A)(1). \u201cAn objection is timely when the issue raised could have been avoided or\n\ncorrected by the court.\u201d Edelstein v. Edelstein, 2025-Ohio-1514, \u00b6 54 (1st Dist.), citing\n\nState ex rel. Holwadel v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, 2015-Ohio-5306, \u00b6 50. The\n\n\n                                            10\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nfailure to timely object to an error waives all but plain-error review on appeal. Anders\n\nv. Seitz, 2023-Ohio-668, \u00b6 15, fn. 3 (12th Dist.) (holding a party\u2019s objection to an\n\nopponent\u2019s qualification to cross-examine the party was untimely where the objection\n\nwas not raised until after the party had examined another witness); Secy. of Veterans\n\nAffairs v. Leonhardt, 2015-Ohio-931, \u00b6 47 (3d Dist.) (\u201cThe failure to timely object to\n\nerrors concerning testimony waives all but plain error on review.\u201d). Plain error is\n\ngenerally not favored in civil cases and may only be applied in the extremely rare\n\ncontext in which an unobjected-to error hampers the basic tenants of fairness and\n\nthereby challenges the validity of the decision of the court below. State ex rel. Target\n\nAuto Repair v. Morales, 2022-Ohio-2062, \u00b6 15, quoting Goldfuss v. Davidson, 79 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 116, 122-123 (1997).\n\n       {\u00b623} Now on appeal, Kelley asserts the court erred in admitting the ACR\n\nguideline because defendants failed to establish a foundation prior to its introduction.\n\nHowever, Kelley failed to timely raise her hearsay objection. Below, Kelley only raised\n\na timely challenge to the admission of the ACR guideline on the basis of relevance. It\n\nwas not until Dr. Mankowski was excused and the court reconvened the following day\n\nthat Kelley asserted that the ACR guideline constituted inadmissible hearsay. Even\n\nwhen assessing the context surrounding Kelley\u2019s initial objection, it is not \u201cobvious\n\nfrom the context\u201d that Kelley was raising a hearsay objection. Kelley\u2019s attempt to\n\nrevisit, reframe, and reraise her objection was ultimately untimely.\n\n       {\u00b624} Because Kelley failed to raise a timely objection, she has waived the\n\nissue for purposes of appeal, Goldfuss at 121 (\u201c[W]e have long recognized, in civil as\n\nwell as criminal cases, that failure to timely advise a trial court of possible error, by\n\nobjection or otherwise, results in a waiver of the issue for purposes of appeal.\u201d), and\n\nthis case does not present one of the extremely rare circumstances in which plain-error\n\n\n                                           11\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nreview would be applicable in a civil case. Goldfuss at 122-123 (\u201c[I]n appeals of civil\n\ncases, the plain error doctrine is not favored and may only be applied in the extremely\n\nrare case involving exceptional circumstances where error, to which no objection was\n\nmade at the trial court, seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of the judicial process, thereby challenging the legitimacy of the underlying\n\njudicial process itself.\u201d). Further, Kelley failed to raise a plain-error argument on\n\nappeal, and we decline to formulate an argument on her behalf. See State v. Williams,\n\n2025-Ohio-1345, \u00b6 45 (1st Dist.); Hotz v. City of Cleveland, 2020-Ohio-1383, \u00b6 38 (8th\n\nDist.) (\u201cA court will not sua sponte undertake a plain-error analysis if a defendant fails\n\nto do so.\u201d); State v. Brunson, 2022-Ohio-4299, \u00b6 24, citing State v. Quarterman,\n\n2014-Ohio-4034, \u00b6 19 (\u201cThis court is not obligated to formulate legal arguments on\n\nbehalf of the parties, because acting as an appellate court, we preside as arbiters of the\n\nlegal questions presented and argued by the parties.\u201d). (Emphasis added.)\n\n       {\u00b625} Even if Kelley\u2019s objection had been timely raised, any reference to the\n\nACR guideline would constitute harmless error. See Hoke v. Miami Valley Hosp.,\n\n2020-Ohio-3387, \u00b6 75-76 (2d Dist.) (holding a failure to establish an adequate\n\nfoundation may give rise to harmless error). \u201cCiv.R. 61 instructs us to \u2018disregard any\n\nerror that does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u2019\u201d Travelers Property\n\nCas. Corp. v. Chiquita Brands Internatl., Inc., 2024-Ohio-1775, \u00b6 36 (1st Dist.); United\n\nBhd. of Carpenters & Joiners, Local Union No. 1581 v. Bell Eng. Ltd., 2006-Ohio-\n\n1891, \u00b6 31 (6th Dist.) (holding errors that do not affect a substantive right in an\n\noutcome-determinative way must be disregarded). The admission of inadmissible\n\nevidence may be harmless when the evidence was cumulative to other testimony and\n\nevidence admitted at trial. In re Z., 2019-Ohio-1617, \u00b6 15 (1st Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b626} Over the course of a seven-day trial, the only use of the ACR guideline\n\n\n                                           12\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\ncame during Dr. Mankowski\u2019s cross-examination. The reliance upon the ACR\n\nguideline was to impeach Dr. Mankowski\u2019s testimony that Dr. Contractor breached the\n\nstandard of care by ordering an MRI without IV contrast. To the contrary, the jury\n\nheard testimony from Dr. Contractor and Dr. Merkler that Dr. Contractor\u2019s diagnosis\n\nand the ordered treatment did not breach the standard of care. Therefore, even if the\n\ncourt erred in admitting inadmissible hearsay, doing so was harmless because it was\n\ncumulative to other testimony provided by other witnesses.\n\n       {\u00b627} Accordingly, Kelley\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                B. Jury Instruction\n\n       {\u00b628} In her second assignment of error, Kelley argues the court erred when\n\nit administered a remote- or intervening-cause jury instruction.\n\n       {\u00b629} We review de novo whether a jury instruction is legally correct and\n\nfactually warranted. Clark v. Durrani, 2025-Ohio-3096, \u00b6 36 (1st Dist.), quoting Jones\n\nv. Durrani, 2024-Ohio-1776, \u00b6 29 (1st Dist.), quoting Cromer v. Children\u2019s Hosp. Med.\n\nCtr. of Akron, 2015-Ohio-229, \u00b6 22. The Ohio Supreme Court has clearly stated that\n\nCiv.R. 51(A) provides,\n\n       [A] party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give any\n\n       instruction unless the party objects before the jury retires to consider its\n\n       verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the grounds of the\n\n       objection.\n\nLeber v. Smith, 70 Ohio St.3d 548, 552 (1994), quoting Civ.R. 51(A).\n\n       {\u00b630} Here, Kelley objected to the remote-, intervening-cause language, but\n\nultimately agreed to the instruction. At the charging conference, Kelley objected\n\nbecause she was concerned that the defendants were going to argue that her failure to\n\nfollow up was an intervening cause. Despite defendants stating they would not do so,\n\n\n                                           13\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nduring closing arguments they reiterated that \u201cyou can\u2019t blame a physician if a patient\n\nchooses not to follow up.\u201d Kelley never objected during closing arguments. In fact,\n\nKelley did not repeat her objection to the jury instruction after closing remarks\n\nconcluded or during the court\u2019s oral jury instructions. Pursuant to Civ.R. 51(A), Kelley\n\nwaived this issue below and is precluded from now raising it on appeal. Accordingly,\n\nKelley\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                  III. Conclusion\n\n        {\u00b631} Having overruled Kelley\u2019s assignments of error, we affirm the judgment\n\nof the trial court.\n\n                                                                   Judgment affirmed.\n\nZAYAS, P.J., and CROUSE, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">[Cite as Kelley v.

Horton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2025-Ohio-5252</span><pre class=\"inline\">.]\n\n\nMOORE, Judge.\n\n        {\u00b61}     Plaintiff-appellant Nanette Kelley appeals the judgment of the\n\nHamilton County Court of Common Pleas after a jury found co-defendants and co-\n\nappellees Dr. Edward S. Horton, Jr., M.D., Dr. Zainab P. Contractor, M.D., Tristate\n\nIMG, Inc., and several TriHealth subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cdefendants\u201d), had not\n\ncommitted medical malpractice. During the course of the trial below, Kelley argued\n\nthat defendants\u2019 medical malpractice caused Kelley to lose vision in her right eye.\n\n        {\u00b62}     Kelley now raises two assignments of error. First, Kelley alleges the\n\ncourt erred in allowing defendants to cross-examine one of Kelley\u2019s witnesses with a\n\npublication under the learned-treatise exception without first requiring defendants to\n\nlay a proper foundation. Second, Kelley argues the court\u2019s jury instructions on remote,\n\nintervening, and superseding causation were legally inaccurate and prejudiced her.\n\n        {\u00b63}     For the reasons set forth below, the trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                      I. Factual History\n\n        {\u00b64}     On January 10, 2023, Kelley filed a complaint against defendants,\n\nalleging claims for medical malpractice. From September 26 through October 4, 2024,\n\nthe court held a seven-day jury trial.\n\n        {\u00b65}     In October 2019, Kelley had her first visit with defendant Dr.\n\nContractor, a neurologist and headache specialist at TriHealth Hospital. On Kelley\u2019s\n\ndiagnostic form, Kelley stated that she had a 30-year history of headaches, that the\n\nnumber of headache days she experienced monthly increased from one to three and\n\nthen from three to five, that the location of her headaches had recently shifted from\n\nthe left to right side of her head, and that her right temple would become sore to the\n\ntouch during headache flareups. Material to this appeal, Kelley was 50 years old when\n\nshe visited with Dr. Contractor and had previously been diagnosed with Chronic\n\f                     OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nKidney Disease in 2016.\n\n       {\u00b66}    At the close of the visit, Dr. Contractor ordered a magnetic resonance\n\nimaging (\u201cMRI\u201d) scan of Kelley\u2019s brain without intravenous (\u201cIV\u201d) fluid contrast. Dr.\n\nContractor explained she normally orders a MRI scan without IV contrast to establish\n\na baseline, and that she would request a scan with IV contrast if she had reason to\n\nbelieve a tumor was present. In her deposition, Dr. Contractor stated that because of\n\nKelley\u2019s history of Chronic Kidney Disease, an MRI scan without contrast was\n\nappropriate for initial screening purposes.\n\n       {\u00b67}    On December 6, 2019, Kelley underwent the MRI scan. Dr. Contractor\u2019s\n\nnotes reviewing the scan identified a few \u201cwhite matter\u201d abnormalities, but noted that\n\nthese were consistent with patients of Kelley\u2019s age, and that it was unlikely that these\n\nwere the cause of Kelley\u2019s headaches. Dr. Contractor believed that these abnormalities\n\nwere attributable to Kelley\u2019s age or her history of Chronic Kidney Disease. At the close\n\nof the visit, Dr. Contractor scheduled a follow-up visit with Kelley in December 2020.\n\n       {\u00b68}    Defendant Dr. Horton, a radiologist, also testified that he interpreted\n\nKelley\u2019s scans. Dr. Horton\u2019s report interpreting the 2019 MRI scan concluded that\n\nthere were no significant abnormalities, such as tumors or hemorrhaging present.\n\n       {\u00b69}    Despite Dr. Contractor\u2019s care plan, Kelley never returned for her follow-\n\nup. Kelley explained that she was reluctant to complete her follow-up with Dr.\n\nContractor, since this was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Kelley\n\ntestified that she continued to work with her primary-care provider throughout 2020\n\nand most of 2021 and that her symptoms had not worsened or changed. However, in\n\nDecember 2021, Kelley\u2019s vision in her right eye abruptly worsened, resulting in near\n\ntotal vision loss.\n\n       {\u00b610} After Kelley\u2019s ophthalmologist could not resolve the issue, she was\n\n\n                                           6\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nreferred to a neurologist and underwent MRI scans with and without contrast. Dr.\n\nHorton again interpreted Kelley\u2019s MRI, and concluded that Kelley had a meningioma\n\nthat had encompassed her right optical nerve.1 Despite surgery and radiation\n\ntreatments, Kelley\u2019s vision in her right eye could not be restored. Kelley recalled that\n\nwhen speaking with her neurosurgeon and radiologist she learned that the\n\nmeningioma was identifiable in her 2019 MRI scan.\n\n       {\u00b611} Dr. Horton testified that he produced a report for both of Kelley\u2019s MRI\n\nscans. Dr. Horton conceded that when comparing the 2022 scan with the 2019 scan,\n\nhe could observe a tumor present within the initial scan. However, Dr. Horton argued\n\nthat his initial interpretation did not breach the standard of care. Dr. Horton explained\n\nthat the tumor was only detectable with the benefit of hindsight, and that many of the\n\nabnormalities that would indicate the presence of a tumor were too subtle for Dr.\n\nHorton to have conclusively determined the presence of a meningioma near Kelley\u2019s\n\noptic nerve.\n\n       {\u00b612} In addition to Kelley, Dr. Contractor, and Dr. Horton, the court heard\n\ntestimony from several experts. On whether Dr. Contractor breached the standard of\n\ncare, the parties called competing neurologists. Kelley introduced Dr. Mankowski,\n\nwhile defendants called Dr. Merkler. On whether Dr. Horton breached the standard of\n\ncare, the parties called competing radiologists. Kelley relied upon Dr. Berger, while\n\ndefendants called Dr. Cizek. Defendants also called Dr. Volpe, a neuro-opthamologist,\n\nwho testified that detection of the tumor in 2019-2020 would not have prevented\n\nKelley from losing her vision in 2021.\n\n\n\n1 A meningioma is a tumor that grows from the membranes that surround the brain and spine, and\n\nmay damage nerves near the brain as the tumor grows. See Mayo Clinic, Meningioma,\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/meningioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20355643\n(accessed Nov. 6, 2025) [https://perma.cc/QQ3Y-AEJH].\n\n\n                                              7\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b613} Material to this appeal, Dr. Mankowski testified that given Kelley\u2019s\n\nsymptoms, Dr. Contractor\u2019s decision to order an MRI scan without IV contrast\n\nbreached the standard of care. During cross-examination, Dr. Mankowski was asked\n\nif he was aware of a guideline from the American College of Radiology (\u201cACR\u201d), the\n\nACR appropriateness criteria for headaches, and whether neurologists were involved\n\nin developing the appropriateness criteria. Dr. Mankowski answered that he was\n\ngenerally aware of all three. When asked whether Dr. Mankowski was \u201caware that the\n\nAmerican College of Radiology --,\u201d counsel for Kelley objected.\n\n       {\u00b614} The parties discussed the objection in chambers. Kelley emphasized two\n\npoints, that Dr. Mankowski was not a radiologist and therefore the reference to the\n\nACR was irrelevant, and that defendants failed to share the document in advance of\n\ntrial. At no point during this initial objection did Kelley contend that the ACR guideline\n\nwas inadmissible hearsay, argue that defendants failed to set forth the proper\n\nfoundation, or assert that the ACR guideline failed to qualify as a learned treatise. The\n\ncourt overruled Kelley\u2019s objection and permitted the defense to continue its line of\n\nquestioning. After recommencing cross-examination, counsel asked Dr. Mankowski\n\nwhether he was aware that the ACR\u2019s appropriateness criteria considered an MRI\n\nwithout IV contrast appropriate, to which Dr. Mankowski answered that he was not\n\naware. Once the parties completed their respective examinations, the court dismissed\n\nDr. Mankowski. At the start of the proceedings the next day, Kelley revisited her\n\nobjection and raised a hearsay objection, arguing that the ACR guideline was not\n\nadmissible under the learned-treatise hearsay exception under Evid.R. 803(18).\n\nAgain, the court overruled Kelley\u2019s objection.\n\n       {\u00b615} During the parties\u2019 charging conference, which took place before the\n\ndefense completed its case and the parties made their closing arguments, the parties\n\n\n                                            8\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\ndiscussed the proposed jury instructions. Kelley objected that the \u201cremote,\n\nintervening, and superseding cause\u201d language was inapplicable because defendants\n\nhad failed to introduce any evidence to demonstrate that Kelley was culpable for her\n\ninjuries. Defendants stated that they were not intending to argue that Kelley was\n\nnegligent. Instead, the defendants argued that the intervening and superseding\n\nlanguage must stay in, in case the jury found for Kelley, since the defendants would\n\nneed to assess if intervening conduct would adjust the damages award. Despite\n\nobjecting, Kelley ultimately agreed.\n\n       {\u00b616} However, during closing arguments, defendants repeatedly referenced\n\nthat Kelley\u2019s actions lead to the late discovery of the tumor. Defendants argued that\n\nKelley chose not to come back to Dr. Contractor for a follow-up visit, and that \u201cyou\n\ncan\u2019t blame a physician if a patient chooses not to follow up.\u201d Despite defendants\u2019\n\nclosing arguments, at no point did Kelley request another opportunity to discuss the\n\njury instructions, nor did she object to defendants\u2019 closing remarks or renew her\n\nobjection to the jury instructions.\n\n       {\u00b617}   This appeal followed.\n\n                                       II. Analysis\n\n       {\u00b618} Kelley raises two assignments of error on appeal, the first of which\n\nargues the court erred in admitting testimony related to the ACR guideline, and the\n\nsecond of which challenges the jury instructions.\n\n                      A.

Below, Kelley only raised\n\na timely challenge to the admission of the ACR guideline on the basis of relevance. It\n\nwas not until Dr. Mankowski was excused and the court reconvened the following day\n\nthat Kelley asserted that the ACR guideline constituted inadmissible hearsay. Even\n\nwhen assessing the context surrounding Kelley\u2019s initial objection, it is not \u201cobvious\n\nfrom the context\u201d that Kelley was raising a hearsay objection. Kelley\u2019s attempt to\n\nrevisit, reframe, and reraise her objection was ultimately untimely.\n\n       {\u00b624} Because Kelley failed to raise a timely objection, she has waived the\n\nissue for purposes of appeal, Goldfuss at 121 (\u201c[W]e have long recognized, in civil as\n\nwell as criminal cases, that failure to timely advise a trial court of possible error, by\n\nobjection or otherwise, results in a waiver of the issue for purposes of appeal.\u201d), and\n\nthis case does not present one of the extremely rare circumstances in which plain-error\n\n\n                                           11\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nreview would be applicable in a civil case.

DeCioccio Showroom, Inc., 2025-Ohio-5253.]\n\n\nCROUSE, Presiding Judge.\n\n        {\u00b61}    When plaintiff-appellant Thomasine Provolish received the custom\n\nchairs she had purchased through defendant-appellee DeCiocco Showroom, Inc.,\n\n(\u201cDeCiocco\u201d) something about them didn\u2019t sit quite right with her. She sued DeCiocco,\n\nasserting that her chairs were much deeper than was specified in her contract with\n\nDeCiocco, and a magistrate ruled in her favor. The trial court, however, rejected the\n\nmagistrate\u2019s decision and went the other way, ruling that the chairs conformed to the\n\nterms of the parties\u2019 contract, as those terms were used in the trade. Because our\n\nreview reveals no error in that determination, we affirm.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n        {\u00b62}    In February 2023, Provolish ordered several pieces of custom furniture\n\nfrom DeCiocco, including two custom chairs. Both parties introduced copies of a\n\ndocument labeled \u201cAcknowledgment / Invoice,\u201d which memorialized the details of\n\ntheir transaction (\u201cthe acknowledgment\u201d).\n\n        {\u00b63}    The acknowledgment specified that the chairs were to be manufactured\n\nby Stewart Furniture (\u201cStewart\u201d) and would be \u201c[s]imilar to concept photo supplied of\n\nTemple Furniture #15935 Fletcher Chair (based on Stewart\u2019s interpretation of the\n\ndesign).\u201d (The reference image of the Fletcher chair was also introduced into\n\nevidence.) The acknowledgment listed numerous dimensions for these custom chairs,\n\nincluding a \u201cdepth\u201d of 38 inches and a \u201cseat depth\u201d of approximately 19 inches. The\n\norder also included one custom, \u201c24[-inch] Square\u201d pillow for each chair, like the one\n\npictured with the Fletcher chair. The acknowledgment clarified that the actual\n\nmeasurements might vary by \u201c+/- up to 1[ inch]\u201d from those provided. It included no\n\ndefinition of \u201cseat depth,\u201d and did not specify the thickness of either the pillows or the\n\nchair\u2019s seat back.\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b64}   When Provolish received her chairs seven months later, she discovered\n\nthat the distance from the front edge of the seat cushion to each chair\u2019s seatback was\n\napproximately 29 inches. Believing this to be a deeper seat than she had ordered,\n\nProvolish reached out to Stewart, who told her to return the chairs. After measuring\n\nthe chairs, Stewart informed Provolish they were within specifications. Stewart\n\nexplained that they measure \u201cseat depth\u201d from the front edge of the seat cushion to the\n\nface of the back pillow or cushion, rather than to the seatback (as Provolish had), and\n\nthat their pillows were made to a 9-inch thickness. Thus, the \u201cseat depth,\u201d as Stewart\n\nmeasured it, was 20 inches (the 29 inches to seatback, less the 9-inch pillow), within\n\nan inch of the requested 19-inch seat depth.\n\n       {\u00b65}   Provolish nevertheless continued to assert that the chairs were not what\n\nshe had ordered. DeCiocco offered to have Stewart remake the pieces and sell them to\n\nProvolish at cost, but Provolish declined this offer.\n\n       {\u00b66}   Provolish then filed a complaint against DeCiocco in the small-claims\n\ndivision of the Hamilton County Municipal Court, where a hearing was held before a\n\nmagistrate. After the hearing, the magistrate rendered a decision for Provolish in the\n\namount of $5,999.\n\n       {\u00b67}   DeCiocco objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision, arguing that (1)\n\nDeCiocco\u2019s contract had been with Provolish\u2019s since-dissolved LLC, not Provolish\n\nherself, and (2) the chairs had conformed to the specifications in the contract. The trial\n\ncourt sustained that second objection and declined to reach the first. The court then\n\nrejected the magistrate\u2019s decision and entered judgment in favor of DeCiocco, from\n\nwhich Provolish now appeals.\n\n                         II. DECIOCCO\u2019S LATE-FILED BRIEF\n\n       {\u00b68}   Before addressing the merits of Provolish\u2019s appeal, we first consider her\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nargument that this court should strike DeCiocco\u2019s brief as untimely filed.\n\n       {\u00b69}    On May 7, this court\u2019s magistrate accepted a late-filed brief from\n\nDeCiocco pursuant to Loc.R. 14(F). In her reply brief, Provolish nevertheless contends\n\nthat DeCiocco\u2019s \u201carguments should be stricken in their entirety\u201d because its brief was\n\nuntimely. Because this court\u2019s magistrate already issued an order accepting DeCiocco\u2019s\n\nbrief, we construe Provolish\u2019s challenge as a request to set aside the magistrate\u2019s order.\n\n       {\u00b610} An appellate court refers matters to a magistrate pursuant to App.R. 34,\n\nwhich incorporates the rules governing magistrate proceedings from Civ.R. 53. Under\n\nthis latter rule, a \u201cmagistrate may enter orders without judicial approval if necessary\n\nto regulate the proceedings and if not dispositive of a claim or defense,\u201d subject to the\n\nterms of the relevant order referring the matter to the magistrate. Civ.R.\n\n53(D)(2)(a)(i). This court\u2019s standing order of reference expressly \u201cempower[s] and\n\nauthorize[s]\u201d its magistrates \u201cto rule on\u201d certain classes of \u201croutine procedural\n\nmotions,\u201d including \u201c[m]otions to extend deadlines for briefs, record, motion\n\nresponse, show cause, or to comply with any other order or rule of this Court.\u201d In re\n\nAmended Order of Reference, No. M-230005 (1st Dist. Aug. 8, 2023). The order in\n\nthis case fell squarely within the scope of that reference, and so could be entered\n\nwithout judicial approval.\n\n       {\u00b611} If Provolish wished this court to set aside the magistrate\u2019s order, she had\n\nto file a timely and separate motion requesting the court do so, not simply refer to the\n\nissue in her brief. Unlike a magistrate\u2019s final decision, which is effective only once\n\nadopted by the referring court, Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(a), a magistrate\u2019s order on a\n\nnondispositive matter is effective and binding unless stayed or set aside by the\n\nreferring court. See Civ.R. 53(D)(2). A party who wishes to challenge a magistrate\u2019s\n\nnondispositive order must \u201cfile a motion with the court to set aside a magistrate\u2019s\n\n\n                                            5\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\norder\u201d within ten days of the order\u2019s filing. (Emphasis added.) Civ.R. 53(D)(2)(b). A\n\n\u201cmotion\u201d is a particular \u201cform\u201d of application to an appellate court, App.R. 15(A),\n\ndistinct from a brief. Compare App.R. 15 and 19(B), and Loc.R. 15 and 19(A), with\n\nApp.R. 16 and 19(A), and Loc.R. 16, 19(B), and 19(C).\n\n       {\u00b612} Provolish failed to properly challenge the magistrate\u2019s order because she\n\nonly raised her issue with the magistrate\u2019s order in her reply brief; she never \u201cfile[d] a\n\nmotion with the court\u201d seeking to set it aside. See Civ.R. 53(D)(2)(b). Because she\n\nnever properly asked us to set it aside, that order is just as valid and effective as any\n\nissued by this court. DeCiocco\u2019s brief was validly accepted under Loc.R. 14(F).\n\n                         III. BREACH-OF-CONTRACT CLAIM\n\n       {\u00b613} Provolish challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling sustaining DeCiocco\u2019s\n\nobjections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and entering judgment for DeCiocco. In two\n\nassignments of error, she argues that the trial court erred by (1) concluding that the\n\nchairs she received conformed to the parties\u2019 contract, and (2) accepting\n\nmeasurements provided by DeCiocco. DeCiocco contests both points and argues that,\n\nin any event, this court can affirm the judgment on the ground that Provolish\u2019s now-\n\ndissolved LLC (not Provolish herself) was a party to the contract.\n\n       {\u00b614} We review the trial court\u2019s decision not to adopt a magistrate\u2019s finding,\n\nconclusion, or decision for an abuse of discretion. See Ditech Fin., L.L.C. v.\n\nBalimunkwe, 2025-Ohio-4884, \u00b6 23 (1st Dist.), citing In re Estate of Knowlton,\n\n2006-Ohio-4905, \u00b6 43 (1st Dist.). But we review the trial court\u2019s own findings and\n\nconclusions as we would in any other case. See id. at \u00b6 24. Thus, we consider legal\n\nquestions de novo, while reviewing the trial court\u2019s factual findings to determine if\n\nthey were against the manifest weight of the evidence. See Washington v. Am. Gen.\n\nLife Ins. Co., 2022-Ohio-339, \u00b6 13 (1st Dist.); Maddali v. Haverkamp,\n\n\n                                            6\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n2022-Ohio-3826, \u00b6 17-18 (1st Dist.). On a manifest-weight review, this court considers\n\nthe record and weighs the evidence and witness credibility to ensure that the trial court\n\ndid not lose its way in resolving evidentiary conflicts and create a manifest miscarriage\n\nof justice necessitating a new trial. Maddali at \u00b6 18, citing Eastley v. Volkman,\n\n2012-Ohio-2179, \u00b6 20.\n\n       {\u00b615} Because Provolish\u2019s second assignment of error (regarding choice of\n\nmeasurements) is logically antecedent to her first (regarding the chairs\u2019 conformity to\n\nthe contract), we address her assignments of error out of order.\n\n                           A. Choice of Measurements\n\n       {\u00b616} In her second assignment of error, Provolish protests the trial court\u2019s\n\nacceptance of measurements provided by a party whom she asserts had \u201ca vested\n\ninterest.\u201d The trial court\u2019s acceptance of the measurements constituted a factual\n\nfinding as to the dimensions of the chairs. We therefore consider only whether it was\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n       {\u00b617} In its decision, the trial court relied on measurements from a series of\n\nphotos taken by Stewart, the chairs\u2019 manufacturer. The photos, which were submitted\n\ninto evidence by DeCiocco, document the chairs\u2019 dimensions by showing a tape\n\nmeasure placed against and along various portions of the chairs and cushions. The\n\ntrial court explained that it relied on these measurements because they were \u201ctaken by\n\na disinterested third party to whom the chairs were returned and where the chairs are\n\ncurrently being stored.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b618} Because Provolish offered no substantive evidence that these\n\nmeasurements were inaccurate, we cannot say the trial court lost its way in accepting\n\nthem as true. While Stewart, as the manufacturer, may not have been an entirely\n\ndisinterested party, Provolish has offered no substantive evidence that Stewart\u2019s\n\n\n                                           7\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nmeasurements were affected by any collateral interest in the outcome or were\n\ninaccurate in any particular way. In fact, Provolish does not argue that any of the\n\nrelevant measurements represented in the photographs are incorrect.\n\n       {\u00b619} We therefore hold that the trial court\u2019s finding that Stewart\u2019s\n\nphotographs accurately reflected the relevant dimensions of the chairs was not against\n\nthe manifest weight of the evidence. Provolish\u2019s second assignment of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n                          B. Contract Meaning & Breach\n\n       {\u00b620} In her first assignment of error, Provolish contends that the trial court\n\nerred in concluding that the measurements provided at trial conformed to the terms\n\nof the contract. In her principal brief to this court, Provolish focuses solely on the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s alleged failure to recognize that \u201c[t]he delivered chairs deviated by 7 inches in\n\nseat depth, substantially breaching the agreed terms.\u201d She makes two arguments on\n\nthis point, which must be understood in the alternative: (1) that the term \u201cseat depth\u201d\n\nreferred to the distance from the front of the seat to the seatback, not to the face of the\n\nback pillow/cushion, and (2) that, in any event, the distance from the front of the chair\n\nto the seatback should have been 22 inches with a 3-inch pillow, just like the Fletcher\n\nchair, which the acknowledgment specified as the design reference.\n\n                              1. Meaning of \u201cSeat Depth\u201d\n\n       {\u00b621} There is no dispute that the acknowledgment promised a chair with a\n\nseat depth of approximately 19 inches, give or take an inch. The question is what \u201cseat\n\ndepth\u201d referred to and whether the chairs satisfied these standards. The\n\nacknowledgment does not define \u201cseat depth,\u201d and the parties offer competing\n\ndefinitions. Provolish contends that \u201cseat depth\u201d refers to the distance from the front\n\nedge of the seat to the seatback (without any pillow). DeCiocco argues that it refers to\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nthe distance from the front edge of the seat to the face of the seatback pillow or\n\ncushion.\n\n       {\u00b622} Determining the meaning of \u201cseat depth\u201d is a question of contract\n\ninterpretation. Because this was a contract primarily for the sale of goods, its\n\ninterpretation is governed by article two of the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d),\n\nadopted by Ohio in R.C. Ch. 1302. See AirBorn Electronics, Inc. v. Magnum Energy\n\nSolutions, L.L.C., 2017-Ohio-70, \u00b6 14 (9th Dist.). When the terms in the parties\u2019\n\n\u201cconfirmatory memoranda\u201d\u2014in this case the copies of the acknowledgment\u2014agree,\n\nthose terms govern the agreement and cannot be contradicted by evidence of prior or\n\ncontemporaneous agreements. R.C. 1302.05 (UCC 2-202). However, terms in the\n\nmemoranda \u201cmay be explained or supplemented . . . by course of performance, course\n\nof dealing, or usage of trade.\u201d R.C. 1302.05(A) (UCC 2-202(a)); see also Varavvas v.\n\nMullet Cabinets, Inc., 2009-Ohio-6962, \u00b6 44 (5th Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b623} In this case, DeCiocco and the trial court relied upon evidence of \u201cusage\n\nof trade,\u201d which can include \u201cany practice or method of dealing having such regularity\n\nof observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be\n\nobserved with respect to the transaction in question.\u201d R.C. 1301.303(C) (UCC 1-\n\n303(c)). Under the UCC, the \u201cexistence and scope\u201d of a trade usage are questions of\n\nfact to be proved by the party asserting the usage. Id.; see also Varavvas at \u00b6 57 (citing\n\nR.C. 1302.11, which has since been reenacted, in relevant part, in R.C. 1301.303); Den\n\nnorske Bank AS v. First Natl. Bank of Boston, 75 F.3d 49, 58-59 (1st Cir. 1996). We\n\ntherefore review findings about trade usage, and the meaning such usages impart to\n\ncontractual terms, as findings of fact under a manifest-weight standard. Compare\n\nVaravvas at \u00b6 58 (upholding interpretation of contract based on trade-usage evidence\n\nbecause party did not raise manifest-weight challenge).\n\n\n                                            9\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n        {\u00b624} Although the parties\u2019 competing definitions of \u201cseat depth\u201d are both\n\nplausible on their face, DeCiocco introduced evidence at the hearing that its definition\n\nwas consistent with usage of trade. Before the magistrate, DeCiocco introduced emails\n\nfrom Nikki Fabrizi, a professional with experience in the furniture-manufacturing\n\nindustry.1 Fabrizi\u2019s email explained that both her firm and Wesley Hall (a well-known\n\nfurniture manufacturer) \u201ccall out a chair\u2019s depth from the front of the chair to the face\n\nof a pillow.\u201d Fabrizi further opined that, if Provolish\u2019s chairs had been only 19 inches\n\nfrom edge to seatback, \u201cthere would be no room for a pillow which, in [Fabrizi\u2019s and\n\nher senior upholsterer\u2019s] opinion, is an integral part of the chair [Provolish] used as a\n\nvisual reference for her desired style.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b625} DeCiocco thus offered evidence that, as used in the trade, \u201cseat depth\u201d\n\nreferred to the depth from the front edge of the seat to the face of the back pillow.\n\nProvolish did not introduce any evidence to rebut this trade understanding. The trial\n\ncourt thus found that DeCiocco\u2019s proposed definition of \u201cseat depth\u201d was consistent\n\nwith its usage in the furniture-manufacturing trade, and that it carried that trade\n\nmeaning in the contract. We cannot say that this finding was contrary to the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence.\n\n        {\u00b626} Under this definition, Provolish\u2019s chairs conformed to the \u201cseat depth\u201d\n\nrequirement in the acknowledgment. The Stewart photographs showed that the chairs\n\nhad a \u201cseat depth\u201d of between 19 and 20 inches when measured from the front edge of\n\nthe seat to the front face of the seatback pillow, which was within 1 inch of the 19-inch\n\n\n\n1 Although these emails are clearly hearsay under Evid.R. 802, \u201cthe Ohio Rules of Evidence do not\n\napply to hearings in small claims court.\u201d See Cunningham v. Michael J. Auto Sales, 2021-Ohio-\n1390, \u00b6 17 (1st Dist.), citing Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Pearlman, 2005-Ohio-4107, \u00b6 15; see also\nEvid.R. 101(D)(8). Rather, in \u201csmall-claims proceedings, \u2018the reliability, credibility, and\nadmissibility of evidence are determined by the trial court.\u2019\u201d Cunningham at \u00b6 18, quoting Karnofel\nv. Girard Police Dept., 2005-Ohio-6154, \u00b6 18 (11th Dist.).\n\n\n                                                10\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nseat depth listed in the acknowledgment. Thus, the trial court did not err in concluding\n\nthat, with respect to their seat depth, the chairs conformed to the contract.\n\n                        2. Deviations from the Reference Chair\n\n       {\u00b627} Provolish also argues, presumably in the alternative, that her chairs\n\nfailed to conform to the agreement because they did not match the dimensions of the\n\nFletcher chair from Temple Furniture, an image of which Provolish provided to\n\nDeCiocco as a reference. According to email correspondence between Provolish and\n\nTemple Furniture, the Fletcher chair had a seat measuring 22 inches from front edge\n\nto seatback without pillow (\u201ctotal seat depth\u201d), and came with a 3-inch-thick pillow.\n\nThese dimensions differed substantially from the chairs Provolish received, which,\n\naccording to Stewart\u2019s photographs, had a total seat depth of roughly 29 inches and\n\ncame with pillows that were roughly 9 inches thick.\n\n       {\u00b628} The acknowledgment states that Provolish\u2019s chairs would be \u201c[s]imilar\n\nto concept photo supplied of Temple Furniture #15935 Fletcher Chair,\u201d but clarified\n\nthey would be \u201cbased on Stewart\u2019s interpretation of the design.\u201d The acknowledgment\n\ndid not list a 22-inch total seat depth or a 3-inch pillow thickness. It is silent as to these\n\ndimensions, providing only for a \u201cseat depth\u201d of 19 inches and a \u201cdepth\u201d of 38 inches.\n\nFurther, no correspondence between the parties prior to the sale cited a desired total\n\nseat depth or pillow thickness.\n\n       {\u00b629} We hold that Provolish and DeCiocco\u2019s contract neither incorporated\n\nthe dimensions of the Fletcher chair itself, nor obligated DeCiocco to discover or solicit\n\nthose dimensions. DeCiocco was obligated to provide chairs that would conform to the\n\ndimensions listed in the acknowledgment and be similar to the design of the Fletcher\n\nchair in the concept photo, as interpreted by Stewart. The contract\u2019s language\n\ntherefore suggested that any gaps in the expressly-listed dimensions would be filled\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nby Stewart\u2019s interpretations of the Fletcher chair design as seen in the photo\u2014not by\n\nthe unlisted dimensions of the actual Fletcher chair. So long as the final product was\n\nwithin the listed specifications and \u201c[s]imilar to [the] concept photo supplied,\u201d it\n\nconformed to the contract.\n\n       {\u00b630} As already explained, the \u201cseat depth\u201d of the delivered chairs was within\n\nan inch of the 19-inch dimension required by the acknowledgment. And Provolish has\n\nnot argued that the chairs\u2019 total depth was anything other than the agreed-upon 38\n\ninches. The chairs therefore conformed to the expressly-listed depth dimensions.\n\nFurther, Provolish has not argued that the finished chairs were not a reasonable\n\ninterpretation of and similar to the reference photo of the Fletcher chair, only that they\n\nfailed to conform to the Fletcher chair\u2019s actual dimensions. Because Provolish did not\n\nmake those additional dimensions a part of the agreement, and because the contract\n\ndid not impose a duty on DeCiocco to discover them, the contract did not require the\n\ntotal seat depth and pillow thickness to match those of the Fletcher chair.\n\n       {\u00b631} Provolish has therefore failed to show that the trial court erred in\n\nconcluding that the chairs she received conformed to the terms of the contract.\n\nProvolish\u2019s first assignment of error is, accordingly, overruled.\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       {\u00b632} The trial court did not err, either in accepting the measurements in\n\nStewart\u2019s photographs or in concluding that the depth of the chairs conformed to the\n\nterms of the agreement. Accordingly, we overrule Provolish\u2019s two assignments of\n\nerror, affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment, and decline to address DeCiocco\u2019s proposed\n\nalternative basis for affirmance.\n\n                                                                     Judgment affirmed.\n\nBOCK and MOORE, JJ., concur.\n\n\n                                           12\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">[Cite as Provolish v.

She sued DeCiocco,\n\nasserting that her chairs were much deeper than was specified in her contract with\n\nDeCiocco, and a magistrate ruled in her favor. The trial court, however, rejected the\n\nmagistrate\u2019s decision and went the other way, ruling that the chairs conformed to the\n\nterms of the parties\u2019 contract, as those terms were used in the trade. Because our\n\nreview reveals no error in that determination, we affirm.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n        {\u00b62}    In February 2023, Provolish ordered several pieces of custom furniture\n\nfrom DeCiocco, including two custom chairs. Both parties introduced copies of a\n\ndocument labeled \u201cAcknowledgment / Invoice,\u201d which memorialized the details of\n\ntheir transaction (\u201cthe acknowledgment\u201d).\n\n        {\u00b63}    The acknowledgment specified that the chairs were to be manufactured\n\nby Stewart Furniture (\u201cStewart\u201d) and would be \u201c[s]imilar to concept photo supplied of\n\nTemple Furniture #15935 Fletcher Chair (based on Stewart\u2019s interpretation of the\n\ndesign).\u201d (The reference image of the Fletcher chair was also introduced into\n\nevidence.) The acknowledgment listed numerous dimensions for these custom chairs,\n\nincluding a \u201cdepth\u201d of 38 inches and a \u201cseat depth\u201d of approximately 19 inches. The\n\norder also included one custom, \u201c24[-inch] Square\u201d pillow for each chair, like the one\n\npictured with the Fletcher chair. The acknowledgment clarified that the actual\n\nmeasurements might vary by \u201c+/- up to 1[ inch]\u201d from those provided. It included no\n\ndefinition of \u201cseat depth,\u201d and did not specify the thickness of either the pillows or the\n\nchair\u2019s seat back.\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b64}   When Provolish received her chairs seven months later, she discovered\n\nthat the distance from the front edge of the seat cushion to each chair\u2019s seatback was\n\napproximately 29 inches. Believing this to be a deeper seat than she had ordered,\n\nProvolish reached out to Stewart, who told her to return the chairs. After measuring\n\nthe chairs, Stewart informed Provolish they were within specifications. Stewart\n\nexplained that they measure \u201cseat depth\u201d from the front edge of the seat cushion to the\n\nface of the back pillow or cushion, rather than to the seatback (as Provolish had), and\n\nthat their pillows were made to a 9-inch thickness. Thus, the \u201cseat depth,\u201d as Stewart\n\nmeasured it, was 20 inches (the 29 inches to seatback, less the 9-inch pillow), within\n\nan inch of the requested 19-inch seat depth.\n\n       {\u00b65}   Provolish nevertheless continued to assert that the chairs were not what\n\nshe had ordered. DeCiocco offered to have Stewart remake the pieces and sell them to\n\nProvolish at cost, but Provolish declined this offer.\n\n       {\u00b66}   Provolish then filed a complaint against DeCiocco in the small-claims\n\ndivision of the Hamilton County Municipal Court, where a hearing was held before a\n\nmagistrate. After the hearing, the magistrate rendered a decision for Provolish in the\n\namount of $5,999.\n\n       {\u00b67}   DeCiocco objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision, arguing that (1)\n\nDeCiocco\u2019s contract had been with Provolish\u2019s since-dissolved LLC, not Provolish\n\nherself, and (2) the chairs had conformed to the specifications in the contract. The trial\n\ncourt sustained that second objection and declined to reach the first. The court then\n\nrejected the magistrate\u2019s decision and entered judgment in favor of DeCiocco, from\n\nwhich Provolish now appeals.\n\n                         II. DECIOCCO\u2019S LATE-FILED BRIEF\n\n       {\u00b68}   Before addressing the merits of Provolish\u2019s appeal, we first consider her\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nargument that this court should strike DeCiocco\u2019s brief as untimely filed.\n\n       {\u00b69}    On May 7, this court\u2019s magistrate accepted a late-filed brief from\n\nDeCiocco pursuant to Loc.R. 14(F). In her reply brief, Provolish nevertheless contends\n\nthat DeCiocco\u2019s \u201carguments should be stricken in their entirety\u201d because its brief was\n\nuntimely. Because this court\u2019s magistrate already issued an order accepting DeCiocco\u2019s\n\nbrief, we construe Provolish\u2019s challenge as a request to set aside the magistrate\u2019s order.\n\n       {\u00b610} An appellate court refers matters to a magistrate pursuant to App.R. 34,\n\nwhich incorporates the rules governing magistrate proceedings from Civ.R. 53. Under\n\nthis latter rule, a \u201cmagistrate may enter orders without judicial approval if necessary\n\nto regulate the proceedings and if not dispositive of a claim or defense,\u201d subject to the\n\nterms of the relevant order referring the matter to the magistrate. Civ.R.\n\n53(D)(2)(a)(i). This court\u2019s standing order of reference expressly \u201cempower[s] and\n\nauthorize[s]\u201d its magistrates \u201cto rule on\u201d certain classes of \u201croutine procedural\n\nmotions,\u201d including \u201c[m]otions to extend deadlines for briefs, record, motion\n\nresponse, show cause, or to comply with any other order or rule of this Court.\u201d In re\n\nAmended Order of Reference, No. M-230005 (1st Dist. Aug. 8, 2023). The order in\n\nthis case fell squarely within the scope of that reference, and so could be entered\n\nwithout judicial approval.\n\n       {\u00b611} If Provolish wished this court to set aside the magistrate\u2019s order, she had\n\nto file a timely and separate motion requesting the court do so, not simply refer to the\n\nissue in her brief. Unlike a magistrate\u2019s final decision, which is effective only once\n\nadopted by the referring court, Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(a), a magistrate\u2019s order on a\n\nnondispositive matter is effective and binding unless stayed or set aside by the\n\nreferring court. See Civ.R. 53(D)(2). A party who wishes to challenge a magistrate\u2019s\n\nnondispositive order must \u201cfile a motion with the court to set aside a magistrate\u2019s\n\n\n                                            5\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\norder\u201d within ten days of the order\u2019s filing. (Emphasis added.) Civ.R. 53(D)(2)(b). A\n\n\u201cmotion\u201d is a particular \u201cform\u201d of application to an appellate court, App.R. 15(A),\n\ndistinct from a brief. Compare App.R. 15 and 19(B), and Loc.R. 15 and 19(A), with\n\nApp.R. 16 and 19(A), and Loc.R. 16, 19(B), and 19(C).\n\n       {\u00b612} Provolish failed to properly challenge the magistrate\u2019s order because she\n\nonly raised her issue with the magistrate\u2019s order in her reply brief; she never \u201cfile[d] a\n\nmotion with the court\u201d seeking to set it aside. See Civ.R. 53(D)(2)(b). Because she\n\nnever properly asked us to set it aside, that order is just as valid and effective as any\n\nissued by this court. DeCiocco\u2019s brief was validly accepted under Loc.R. 14(F).\n\n                         III. BREACH-OF-CONTRACT CLAIM\n\n       {\u00b613} Provolish challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling sustaining DeCiocco\u2019s\n\nobjections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and entering judgment for DeCiocco. In two\n\nassignments of error, she argues that the trial court erred by (1) concluding that the\n\nchairs she received conformed to the parties\u2019 contract, and (2) accepting\n\nmeasurements provided by DeCiocco. DeCiocco contests both points and argues that,\n\nin any event, this court can affirm the judgment on the ground that Provolish\u2019s now-\n\ndissolved LLC (not Provolish herself) was a party to the contract.\n\n       {\u00b614} We review the trial court\u2019s decision not to adopt a magistrate\u2019s finding,\n\nconclusion, or decision for an abuse of discretion.

Choice of Measurements\n\n       {\u00b616} In her second assignment of error, Provolish protests the trial court\u2019s\n\nacceptance of measurements provided by a party whom she asserts had \u201ca vested\n\ninterest.\u201d The trial court\u2019s acceptance of the measurements constituted a factual\n\nfinding as to the dimensions of the chairs. We therefore consider only whether it was\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n       {\u00b617} In its decision, the trial court relied on measurements from a series of\n\nphotos taken by Stewart, the chairs\u2019 manufacturer. The photos, which were submitted\n\ninto evidence by DeCiocco, document the chairs\u2019 dimensions by showing a tape\n\nmeasure placed against and along various portions of the chairs and cushions. The\n\ntrial court explained that it relied on these measurements because they were \u201ctaken by\n\na disinterested third party to whom the chairs were returned and where the chairs are\n\ncurrently being stored.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b618} Because Provolish offered no substantive evidence that these\n\nmeasurements were inaccurate, we cannot say the trial court lost its way in accepting\n\nthem as true. While Stewart, as the manufacturer, may not have been an entirely\n\ndisinterested party, Provolish has offered no substantive evidence that Stewart\u2019s\n\n\n                                           7\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nmeasurements were affected by any collateral interest in the outcome or were\n\ninaccurate in any particular way. In fact, Provolish does not argue that any of the\n\nrelevant measurements represented in the photographs are incorrect.\n\n       {\u00b619} We therefore hold that the trial court\u2019s finding that Stewart\u2019s\n\nphotographs accurately reflected the relevant dimensions of the chairs was not against\n\nthe manifest weight of the evidence. Provolish\u2019s second assignment of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n                          B. Contract Meaning &amp; Breach\n\n       {\u00b620} In her first assignment of error, Provolish contends that the trial court\n\nerred in concluding that the measurements provided at trial conformed to the terms\n\nof the contract. In her principal brief to this court, Provolish focuses solely on the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s alleged failure to recognize that \u201c[t]he delivered chairs deviated by 7 inches in\n\nseat depth, substantially breaching the agreed terms.\u201d She makes two arguments on\n\nthis point, which must be understood in the alternative: (1) that the term \u201cseat depth\u201d\n\nreferred to the distance from the front of the seat to the seatback, not to the face of the\n\nback pillow/cushion, and (2) that, in any event, the distance from the front of the chair\n\nto the seatback should have been 22 inches with a 3-inch pillow, just like the Fletcher\n\nchair, which the acknowledgment specified as the design reference.\n\n                              1. Meaning of \u201cSeat Depth\u201d\n\n       {\u00b621} There is no dispute that the acknowledgment promised a chair with a\n\nseat depth of approximately 19 inches, give or take an inch. The question is what \u201cseat\n\ndepth\u201d referred to and whether the chairs satisfied these standards. The\n\nacknowledgment does not define \u201cseat depth,\u201d and the parties offer competing\n\ndefinitions. Provolish contends that \u201cseat depth\u201d refers to the distance from the front\n\nedge of the seat to the seatback (without any pillow). DeCiocco argues that it refers to\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nthe distance from the front edge of the seat to the face of the seatback pillow or\n\ncushion.\n\n       {\u00b622} Determining the meaning of \u201cseat depth\u201d is a question of contract\n\ninterpretation. Because this was a contract primarily for the sale of goods, its\n\ninterpretation is governed by article two of the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d),\n\nadopted by Ohio in R.C. Ch. 1302.

Before the magistrate, DeCiocco introduced emails\n\nfrom Nikki Fabrizi, a professional with experience in the furniture-manufacturing\n\nindustry.1 Fabrizi\u2019s email explained that both her firm and Wesley Hall (a well-known\n\nfurniture manufacturer) \u201ccall out a chair\u2019s depth from the front of the chair to the face\n\nof a pillow.\u201d Fabrizi further opined that, if Provolish\u2019s chairs had been only 19 inches\n\nfrom edge to seatback, \u201cthere would be no room for a pillow which, in [Fabrizi\u2019s and\n\nher senior upholsterer\u2019s] opinion, is an integral part of the chair [Provolish] used as a\n\nvisual reference for her desired style.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b625} DeCiocco thus offered evidence that, as used in the trade, \u201cseat depth\u201d\n\nreferred to the depth from the front edge of the seat to the face of the back pillow.\n\nProvolish did not introduce any evidence to rebut this trade understanding. The trial\n\ncourt thus found that DeCiocco\u2019s proposed definition of \u201cseat depth\u201d was consistent\n\nwith its usage in the furniture-manufacturing trade, and that it carried that trade\n\nmeaning in the contract. We cannot say that this finding was contrary to the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence.\n\n        {\u00b626} Under this definition, Provolish\u2019s chairs conformed to the \u201cseat depth\u201d\n\nrequirement in the acknowledgment. The Stewart photographs showed that the chairs\n\nhad a \u201cseat depth\u201d of between 19 and 20 inches when measured from the front edge of\n\nthe seat to the front face of the seatback pillow, which was within 1 inch of the 19-inch\n\n\n\n1 Although these emails are clearly hearsay under Evid.R. 802, \u201cthe Ohio Rules of Evidence do not\n\napply to hearings in small claims court.\u201d See Cunningham v.

Thus, the trial court did not err in concluding\n\nthat, with respect to their seat depth, the chairs conformed to the contract.\n\n                        2. Deviations from the Reference Chair\n\n       {\u00b627} Provolish also argues, presumably in the alternative, that her chairs\n\nfailed to conform to the agreement because they did not match the dimensions of the\n\nFletcher chair from Temple Furniture, an image of which Provolish provided to\n\nDeCiocco as a reference. According to email correspondence between Provolish and\n\nTemple Furniture, the Fletcher chair had a seat measuring 22 inches from front edge\n\nto seatback without pillow (\u201ctotal seat depth\u201d), and came with a 3-inch-thick pillow.\n\nThese dimensions differed substantially from the chairs Provolish received, which,\n\naccording to Stewart\u2019s photographs, had a total seat depth of roughly 29 inches and\n\ncame with pillows that were roughly 9 inches thick.\n\n       {\u00b628} The acknowledgment states that Provolish\u2019s chairs would be \u201c[s]imilar\n\nto concept photo supplied of Temple Furniture #15935 Fletcher Chair,\u201d but clarified\n\nthey would be \u201cbased on Stewart\u2019s interpretation of the design.\u201d The acknowledgment\n\ndid not list a 22-inch total seat depth or a 3-inch pillow thickness. It is silent as to these\n\ndimensions, providing only for a \u201cseat depth\u201d of 19 inches and a \u201cdepth\u201d of 38 inches.\n\nFurther, no correspondence between the parties prior to the sale cited a desired total\n\nseat depth or pillow thickness.\n\n       {\u00b629} We hold that Provolish and DeCiocco\u2019s contract neither incorporated\n\nthe dimensions of the Fletcher chair itself, nor obligated DeCiocco to discover or solicit\n\nthose dimensions. DeCiocco was obligated to provide chairs that would conform to the\n\ndimensions listed in the acknowledgment and be similar to the design of the Fletcher\n\nchair in the concept photo, as interpreted by Stewart. The contract\u2019s language\n\ntherefore suggested that any gaps in the expressly-listed dimensions would be filled\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nby Stewart\u2019s interpretations of the Fletcher chair design as seen in the photo\u2014not by\n\nthe unlisted dimensions of the actual Fletcher chair. So long as the final product was\n\nwithin the listed specifications and \u201c[s]imilar to [the] concept photo supplied,\u201d it\n\nconformed to the contract.\n\n       {\u00b630} As already explained, the \u201cseat depth\u201d of the delivered chairs was within\n\nan inch of the 19-inch dimension required by the acknowledgment. And Provolish has\n\nnot argued that the chairs\u2019 total depth was anything other than the agreed-upon 38\n\ninches. The chairs therefore conformed to the expressly-listed depth dimensions.\n\nFurther, Provolish has not argued that the finished chairs were not a reasonable\n\ninterpretation of and similar to the reference photo of the Fletcher chair, only that they\n\nfailed to conform to the Fletcher chair\u2019s actual dimensions. Because Provolish did not\n\nmake those additional dimensions a part of the agreement, and because the contract\n\ndid not impose a duty on DeCiocco to discover them, the contract did not require the\n\ntotal seat depth and pillow thickness to match those of the Fletcher chair.\n\n       {\u00b631} Provolish has therefore failed to show that the trial court erred in\n\nconcluding that the chairs she received conformed to the terms of the contract.\n\nProvolish\u2019s first assignment of error is, accordingly, overruled.\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       {\u00b632} The trial court did not err, either in accepting the measurements in\n\nStewart\u2019s photographs or in concluding that the depth of the chairs conformed to the\n\nterms of the agreement. Accordingly, we overrule Provolish\u2019s two assignments of\n\nerror, affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment, and decline to address DeCiocco\u2019s proposed\n\nalternative basis for affirmance.\n\n                                                                     Judgment affirmed.\n\nBOCK and MOORE, JJ., concur.\n\n\n                                           12\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "ordering_key": null, "main_version": null, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/196552/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/2690817/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/3758017/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/3777184/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/4114857/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/6216699/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/8406391/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/11177024/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/11206867/", "id": 11206867, "absolute_url": "/opinion/10740282/state-v-bailey/", "cluster_id": 10740282, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/clusters/10740282/", "author_id": null, "author": null, "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2025-11-21T07:18:45.721852-08:00", "date_modified": "2025-11-21T07:18:46.830180-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "8cb78dc472920164266ceea4812e5c560987a614", "page_count": 6, "download_url": "https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/1/2025/2025-Ohio-5254.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2025/11/21/state_v._bailey.pdf", "plain_text": "[Cite as State v.

Bailey, 2025-Ohio-5254.]\n\n\nBOCK, Judge.\n\n        {\u00b61}     After Christopher Bailey pleaded guilty to two fifth-degree felonies, the\n\ntrial court imposed two 12-month sentences, to be served concurrently, for an\n\naggregate sentence of 12 months\u2019 incarceration. On appeal, Bailey asserts that the trial\n\ncourt improperly determined that he was not entitled to a community-control sanction\n\ninstead of incarceration, that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s sentencing\n\nfindings, and that the trial court based its sentence on improper considerations\u2014\n\nBailey\u2019s possession of a machete.\n\n        {\u00b62}     We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment. First, while in some circumstances,\n\nR.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) carries a presumption of community control for fifth-degree\n\nfelonies, that section of the statute does not apply because Bailey was convicted of\n\nmultiple fifth-degree felonies. Second, Bailey\u2019s record-based challenge to his sentence\n\nfails because an appellate court cannot vacate or modify a sentence based on its view\n\nthat the sentence is not supported by the record under R.C. 2929.11 or 2929.12. Finally,\n\nthe trial court properly considered Bailey\u2019s possession of a machete because that fact\n\nwas relevant to the seriousness of the offense and the impact Bailey\u2019s conduct had on\n\nthe victim.\n\n                           I. Factual and Procedural History\n\n        {\u00b63}     On two days in September 2024, Bailey attempted to enter separate\n\nbuildings while trespassing in both instances.\n\n        {\u00b64}     The State indicted Bailey on two fifth-degree felony counts of attempt\n\nin violation of R.C. 2923.02(A) for acts that, if successful, would have constituted\n\nburglary in violation of R.C. 2911.12(B).\n\n        {\u00b65}     Bailey pleaded guilty to both counts and the trial court sentenced him\n\nto 12 months\u2019 incarceration on each count, ordered the sentences to be served\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nconcurrently, and credited Bailey with 156 days of time served.\n\n                                     II. Analysis\n\n       {\u00b66}   In his sole assignment of error, Bailey argues that the trial court erred\n\nin imposing the sentences.\n\n       A. Standard of review\n\n       {\u00b67}   R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) provides that an appellate court may modify\n\ncriminal sentences if the court clearly and convincingly finds, relevant here, that (1)\n\nthe sentence is contrary to law, or (2) the record does not support the sentencing\n\ncourt\u2019s findings under R.C. 2929.13 (B).\n\n       B. R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a)\u2019s applicability\n\n       {\u00b68}   Bailey asserts that the trial court improperly determined he was not\n\nentitled to a mandatory community-control term under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a).\n\n       {\u00b69}   With some exceptions not relevant here, R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) requires\n\ntrial courts to sentence defendants convicted of a fourth- or fifth-degree felony \u201cthat is\n\nnot an offense of violence or that is a qualifying assault offense\u201d to a term of\n\ncommunity control when three factors apply: the defendant (1) has no previous felony\n\nconvictions, (2) is not facing a charge greater than a fourth-degree felony, and (3) in\n\nthe two years before the offense for which the defendant is being sentenced, the\n\ndefendant was not convicted of a misdemeanor offense of violence.\n\n       {\u00b610} Because R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) applies when a defendant is convicted of\n\n\u201ca felony of the fourth or fifth degree,\u201d Ohio courts have held that the community-\n\ncontrol presumption applies only if the defendant is convicted of a single, nonviolent\n\nfelony of the fourth or fifth degree. See State v. Melson, 2022-Ohio-2709, \u00b6 13 (2d\n\nDist.); see also State v. Boswell, 2019-Ohio-2949, \u00b6 22 (6th Dist.); State v. Durant,\n\n2016-Ohio-8173, \u00b6 10 (7th Dist.); State v. Parrado, 2016-Ohio-1313, \u00b6 23 (11th Dist.)\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n(\u201cIf the legislature intended the presumption pertaining to community control to apply\n\nto situations in which an offender was convicted of or pleaded guilty to multiple\n\nfelonies of the . . . fifth degree, it could have pluralized these terms.\u201d). Accordingly,\n\nR.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) does not apply when defendants are convicted of multiple\n\nfourth- or fifth-degree felonies and the trial court may impose prison sentences.\n\n       {\u00b611} Bailey was convicted of two fifth-degree felonies. Therefore, R.C.\n\n2929.13(B)(1)(a) did not apply and the trial court was free to impose prison sentences.\n\n       C. Challenge to the trial court\u2019s sentencing findings\n\n       {\u00b612} Bailey, citing the purposes of felony sentencing set out in R.C.\n\n2929.11(B) and 2929.12(A), next argues that the \u201crecord does not demonstrate that the\n\ntrial court gave adequate consideration to the appropriate sentencing factors,\u201d\n\npointing to Bailey\u2019s well-documented mental-health issues and need for treatment.\n\n       {\u00b613} Ohio appellate courts lack authority to vacate or modify sentences\n\nsimply because they believe that, under R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12, the sentence is not\n\nsupported by the record. State v. Poveda, 2025-Ohio-1075, \u00b6 10 (1st Dist.), quoting\n\nState v. Jones, 2020-Ohio-6729, \u00b6 39; see State v. Bryant, 2022-Ohio-1878, \u00b6 21\n\n(\u201cR.C. 2953.08(G)(2) does not permit an appellate court to conduct an independent\n\nreview of a trial court\u2019s sentencing findings under R.C. 2929.12 or its adherence to the\n\npurposes of felony sentencing under R.C. 2929.11.\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b614} Bailey\u2019s R.C. 2929.11- and 2929.12-based challenges are not reviewable\n\nby this court, so his second argument fails.\n\n       D. Improper considerations\n\n       {\u00b615} Finally, Bailey argues that the trial court\u2019s sentences are contrary to law\n\nbecause the trial court based them on improper considerations.\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b616} \u201c[W]hen a trial court imposes a sentence based on factors or\n\nconsiderations that are extraneous to those that are permitted by R.C. 2929.11 and\n\n2929.12, that sentence is contrary to law\u201d and reviewable under R.C.\n\n2953.08(G)(2)(b). Bryant, 2022-Ohio-1878, at \u00b6 22.\n\n       {\u00b617} Bailey asserts that when imposing its sentences, the trial court\n\nimproperly considered his possession of a machete during one of the attempted\n\nburglaries. Though the factual record in this case is undeveloped, it appears that the\n\nowner of the building identified in count one confronted Bailey, and he reacted by\n\ndrawing a machete.\n\n       {\u00b618}   \u201cA sentence imposed for a felony shall be reasonably calculated to\n\nachieve the three overriding purposes of felony sentencing . . . commensurate with and\n\nnot demeaning to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and its impact upon the\n\nvictim, and consistent with sentences imposed for similar crimes committed by similar\n\noffenders.\u201d R.C. 2929.11(B).\n\n       {\u00b619} The trial court properly considered Bailey\u2019s possession of a machete. He\n\nhad the machete when he attempted to access a building and he drew the machete\n\nwhen the owner confronted him. Bailey\u2019s possession of the machete was relevant to\n\nthe trial court\u2019s consideration of both the \u201cseriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct\u201d and\n\nBailey\u2019s conduct\u2019s \u201cimpact upon the victim.\u201d R.C. 2929.11(B).\n\n       {\u00b620} We overrule Bailey\u2019s assignment of error.\n\n                                     III. Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b621} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule Bailey\u2019s assignment of error and\n\naffirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n                                                                  Judgment affirmed.\n\nKINSLEY, P.J., and CROUSE, J., concur.\n\n\n                                           6\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">[Cite as State v.

R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a)\u2019s applicability\n\n       {\u00b68}   Bailey asserts that the trial court improperly determined he was not\n\nentitled to a mandatory community-control term under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a).\n\n       {\u00b69}   With some exceptions not relevant here, R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) requires\n\ntrial courts to sentence defendants convicted of a fourth- or fifth-degree felony \u201cthat is\n\nnot an offense of violence or that is a qualifying assault offense\u201d to a term of\n\ncommunity control when three factors apply: the defendant (1) has no previous felony\n\nconvictions, (2) is not facing a charge greater than a fourth-degree felony, and (3) in\n\nthe two years before the offense for which the defendant is being sentenced, the\n\ndefendant was not convicted of a misdemeanor offense of violence.\n\n       {\u00b610} Because R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) applies when a defendant is convicted of\n\n\u201ca felony of the fourth or fifth degree,\u201d Ohio courts have held that the community-\n\ncontrol presumption applies only if the defendant is convicted of a single, nonviolent\n\nfelony of the fourth or fifth degree.

Therefore, R.C.\n\n2929.13(B)(1)(a) did not apply and the trial court was free to impose prison sentences.\n\n       C. Challenge to the trial court\u2019s sentencing findings\n\n       {\u00b612} Bailey, citing the purposes of felony sentencing set out in R.C.\n\n2929.11(B) and 2929.12(A), next argues that the \u201crecord does not demonstrate that the\n\ntrial court gave adequate consideration to the appropriate sentencing factors,\u201d\n\npointing to Bailey\u2019s well-documented mental-health issues and need for treatment.\n\n       {\u00b613} Ohio appellate courts lack authority to vacate or modify sentences\n\nsimply because they believe that, under R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12, the sentence is not\n\nsupported by the record.

Barker, 2025-Ohio-5251.]\n\n\nMOORE, Judge.\n\n        {\u00b61}     Plaintiff-appellant, the State of Ohio, appeals the judgment of the\n\nHamilton County Court of Common Pleas granting defendant-appellee Tyshawn\n\nBarker\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. In his petition, Barker sought to vacate his\n\nconvictions for two counts of aggravated murder, three counts of tampering with\n\nevidence, and two counts of aggravated robbery because his trial counsel had been\n\nconstitutionally ineffective regarding Barker\u2019s motion to suppress his statements to\n\npolice. While we hold that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in determining\n\nthat Barker\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the common pleas court failed\n\nto engage in the appropriate analysis to determine whether Barker had been\n\nprejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance. We also hold that the common pleas\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by vacating the dismissal of Barker\u2019s January 2014\n\npetition. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in part and remand the\n\ncause for the common pleas court to apply the appropriate prejudice analysis. The\n\nlower court\u2019s judgment is affirmed in all other respects.\n\n                          I. Factual and Procedural History\n\n        {\u00b62}     This is the fourth time that this case has been before this court. We\n\nbriefly summarized the details of the offenses in a previous decision as follows:\n\n        Mr. Barker, Dequantez Nixon, Brendan Washington and Carrielle Conn\n\n        went to an apartment intending to kill one man but murdered a different\n\n        man who had the bad luck to answer the door. Ms. Conn was the shooter\n\n        in the first murder. Worried that Conn might snitch, her three\n\n        companions lured her into the woods and killed her two days later.\n\nState v. Barker, 2016-Ohio-7059, \u00b6 3 (1st Dist.).\n\n        {\u00b63}     Shortly before midnight, the day after Conn was murdered, 15-year-old\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nBarker was questioned about the shootings at police headquarters by Cincinnati Police\n\nDetectives Kurt Ballman and Terry McGuffey. Another suspect in the shootings,\n\nNixon, had implicated Barker during questioning earlier in the evening, and Barker\n\nwas found at Nixon\u2019s apartment when police were executing a search warrant.\n\n       {\u00b64}   The detectives began Barker\u2019s questioning by asking Barker\u2019s name,\n\naddress, phone number, age, mother\u2019s name, and where he went to school, whether he\n\ncould read and write, and whether he had consumed any alcohol or drugs. Detective\n\nBallman then read the Miranda warnings to Barker\u2014that he had the right to remain\n\nsilent, that anything he said could be used as evidence against him, and that he had\n\nthe right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed if he could not\n\nafford one. Barker told the detectives that he understood his rights, but when asked if\n\nhe had heard of Miranda warnings before, he replied that this was his \u201cfirst time.\u201d\n\nWhen questioned further, Barker stated that he had previously heard Miranda\n\nwarnings read on television.\n\n       {\u00b65}   The detectives then continued their interrogation without asking Barker\n\nwhether he wanted to continue or speak with an attorney, and Barker made statements\n\nimplicating himself in the shootings.\n\n       {\u00b66}   The next day, the two detectives visited Barker at the juvenile detention\n\nfacility. After Detective Ballman informed Barker that he was going to read the\n\nMiranda warnings to him again, Barker stated, \u201cI\u2019ve seen an attorney \u2013 whatever that\n\nis.\u201d This time Barker was asked whether he wanted to continue speaking with police\n\nor talk to his attorney, and Barker chose to continue. He then identified Washington\n\nfrom a picture and the interview ended.\n\n                                 A. Juvenile Court\n\n       {\u00b67}   Barker was eventually charged in juvenile court with various offenses\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nrelated to the shootings. After the juvenile court determined that there was probable\n\ncause that Barker had participated in the charged offenses, Barker was evaluated by\n\nDr. Paul Deardorff, a court-appointed psychologist, who offered an opinion on\n\nwhether Barker was amenable to rehabilitation in the juvenile court system. In his\n\nreport, he stated that there were several factors that indicated that Barker should not\n\nbe bound over to adult court, including:\n\n       his age, lack of prior history of involvement with the mental health\n\n       system, minimal involvement with the Juvenile Court system, minimal\n\n       attempts to treat or rehabilitate, a strong relationship with his mother,\n\n       exposure to abuse, the deaths of many relatives and one friend, his\n\n       special education background which includes an IEP, an apparent\n\n       history of ridicule, and his limited intellect.\n\n       {\u00b68}    Dr. Deardorff described Barker\u2019s intellect as borderline or \u201cmildly\n\nmentally retarded.\u201d Despite the factors indicating that Barker should not be\n\ntransferred to adult court, Dr. Deardorff explained in the report that he thought the\n\ncourt needed to balance those factors with the \u201cvery serious nature\u201d of the charges.\n\n       {\u00b69}    Following the amenability hearing, at which Dr. Deardorff did not\n\ntestify but his report was considered, the juvenile court determined that Barker was\n\nnot amenable to rehabilitation in the juvenile court system and transferred his case to\n\nadult court.\n\n                            B. Adult-Court Proceedings\n\n       {\u00b610} After being transferred to adult court, Barker and his codefendants,\n\nNixon and Washington, were each charged with four counts of aggravated murder, two\n\ncounts of conspiracy, two counts of aggravated robbery, and three counts of tampering\n\nwith evidence, all with gun and witness specifications. Barker filed a motion to\n\n\n                                             5\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nsuppress his statements to police, arguing that he did not knowingly, intelligently, or\n\nvoluntarily waive his Miranda rights. Nixon and Washington also filed motions to\n\nsuppress their individual statements, and a joint hearing was held on the motions. At\n\nthe hearing, Detective Ballman testified as to how each defendant was developed as a\n\nsuspect. On cross-examination by Barker\u2019s counsel, Detective Ballman conceded he\n\ndid not ask Barker detailed questions about his intellect, such as whether he was in\n\nany specialized educational program, but testified that he had no reason to believe that\n\nBarker did not understand the questions or the ongoing conversation during Barker\u2019s\n\npolice interview. Video and audio recordings of the police interrogation of each suspect\n\nwere admitted into evidence.\n\n        {\u00b611} A few days after the hearing, the trial court denied the motions to\n\nsuppress from the bench, but the entry denying Barker\u2019s motion was never entered on\n\nthe docket. Additionally, the entry setting Barker\u2019s motion for a hearing was also not\n\ndocketed.\n\n        {\u00b612} In February 2013, Barker entered into an agreement with the State\n\nwhere the State agreed to dismiss the two conspiracy counts and several of the\n\nspecifications to other counts in exchange for Barker entering a no-contest plea to each\n\nof the remaining offenses. At the plea hearing, the State read into the record the\n\noffenses against Barker as set forth in the indictment. Barker pled no-contest to each\n\noffense and was found guilty. The following month, a joint sentencing hearing was\n\nheld for all three defendants. Barker was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 25\n\nyears to life.\n\n                                  C. Direct Appeal\n\n        {\u00b613} We affirmed Barker\u2019s convictions on direct appeal, overruling\n\nassignments of error challenging (1) his transfer to adult court, (2) the denial of his\n\n\n                                           6\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nmotion to suppress, and (3) counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness at the amenability and motion-\n\nto-suppress hearings. State v. Barker, 2014-Ohio-3245 (1st Dist.). We briefly note that\n\nBarker\u2019s assignment of error as to his motion to suppress was raised after Barker\u2019s\n\nappellate counsel sought leave of court to raise an additional assignment of error,\n\nexplaining that she had been unaware that a suppression hearing had occurred and\n\nthat Barker\u2019s suppression motion had been denied because there were no entries on\n\nthe docket.\n\n       {\u00b614} The Ohio Supreme Court reversed our judgment in Barker\u2019s direct\n\nappeal because, in determining that Barker had knowingly waived his Miranda rights,\n\nwe referenced an Ohio statute, R.C. 2933.81(B), which creates a presumption that\n\nelectronically-recorded statements by suspects of certain crimes are voluntary. The\n\nCourt held that that statute was unconstitutional as applied to juveniles and remanded\n\nthe case to us to consider the Miranda waiver. State v. Barker, 2016-Ohio-2708.\n\n       {\u00b615} On remand, we considered the totality of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding Barker\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights, including his age, and held that he\n\nhad voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly waived his Miranda rights. State v.\n\nBarker, 2016-Ohio-7059 (1st Dist.), appeal not accepted for review, 2017-Ohio-4038.\n\nIn reaching our holding, we also noted, with respect to Barker\u2019s argument that he was\n\nunable to understand his rights because of his low intelligence, that Dr. Deardorff\u2019s\n\namenability report, which noted Barker\u2019s low intelligence, was not introduced into\n\nevidence at the suppression hearing, but even if it had been, \u201cnothing in the report\n\nindicated that Barker was incapable of understanding the Miranda rights as they were\n\nread to him.\u201d Id. \u00b6 22.\n\n                          D. Postconviction Proceedings\n\n       {\u00b616} In January 2014, while his direct appeal was pending, Barker filed a\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\npetition to vacate or set aside his convictions under R.C. 2953.21. In his petition,\n\nBarker asserted that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing \u201cto investigate and\n\nprepare a case to establish that [Barker] was amenable to rehabilitation in the juvenile\n\njustice system.\u201d Specifically, Barker claimed that his trial counsel should have called\n\nDr. Deardorff as a witness at the amenability hearing and should have had Barker\n\nevaluated by defense\u2019s own expert to show that his age and cognitive impairment\n\nlimited his culpability. Within the petition, Barker indicated that he intended to\n\namend the petition with the report and affidavit of an independent forensic\n\npsychologist and was in the process of securing those services.\n\n       {\u00b617} Four months later, Barker filed a pleading entitled \u201cInformation to\n\nCourt Regarding Amended Petition to Vacate or Set Aside Conviction under R.C.\n\n2953.21\u201d (\u201cthe Notice\u201d). In the Notice, postconviction counsel informed the court that\n\nDr. Daniel L. Davis, board certified in forensic psychology and specializing in\n\njuveniles, had evaluated and prepared a report regarding Barker\u2019s amenability to\n\nrehabilitation in juvenile court. However, postconviction counsel explained that she\n\nhad just recently discovered that a motion to suppress had been filed (and denied\n\nfollowing a hearing) in Barker\u2019s case. Counsel explained that because an entry denying\n\nthe motion to suppress had never been docketed, she was unaware of those\n\nproceedings. Consequently, postconviction counsel notified the court that Dr. Davis\n\nwas now also going to evaluate Barker as to whether he had the ability to effectively\n\nwaive his Miranda rights given his low-cognitive functioning. Postconviction counsel\n\nstated that the amended petition would be filed, which would include an additional\n\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim related to Barker\u2019s motion to suppress his\n\nstatements, after both reports had been received from Dr. Davis.\n\n       {\u00b618} Two weeks later, on May 30, 2014, the State filed a memorandum in\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nopposition to Barker\u2019s petition, arguing that Barker had not presented substantive\n\ngrounds for relief. Specifically, the State noted that there was no evidence attached to\n\nthe petition to demonstrate trial counsel had failed to investigate Barker\u2019s amenability\n\nto rehabilitation nor was there a report by an expert demonstrating that Barker\u2019s\n\ncognitive limitations and age made him amenable to rehabilitation. Two weeks after\n\nthe State\u2019s filing, the common pleas court dismissed Barker\u2019s petition.\n\n        {\u00b619} We affirmed the dismissal1 of Barker\u2019s petition on appeal, holding that\n\nthere was no evidence attached to Barker\u2019s petition to \u201cdemonstrate an outcome-\n\ndeterminative deficiency in his counsel\u2019s performance at the [amenability] hearing.\u201d\n\nState v. Barker, 2016-Ohio-8476, \u00b6 19 (1st Dist.). We also held that the common pleas\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Barker\u2019s petition where Barker failed to\n\namend the petition with the promised reports or request a stay. Id. at \u00b6 24.\n\n        {\u00b620} In November 2014, Barker filed two pleadings: a petition for\n\npostconviction relief and a Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate the common pleas court\u2019s\n\nJune 2014 dismissal of his January 2014 petition for postconviction relief.\n\n        {\u00b621} In his November 2014 petition, Barker sets forth one claim: his trial\n\ncounsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to investigate and present evidence\n\nof his low intelligence and cognitive delays at the suppression hearing and, specifically,\n\nfor failing to have Barker evaluated by a forensic psychologist with the Miranda Rights\n\nComprehension Instrument and presenting those test results at the suppression\n\nhearing. In support of his petition, Barker attached Dr. Davis\u2019s curriculum vitae and\n\nhis evaluation report, which indicated that Barker has a full-scale IQ score of 70, which\n\n\n\n\n1 Although the common pleas court\u2019s entry indicates that it is \u201cdismissing\u201d Barker\u2019s January 2014\n\npetition, in the direct appeal from that judgment, this court referred to the lower court\u2019s judgment\nas \u201cdenying\u201d the petition.\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nis in the second percentile, indicating an intellectual disability, and a reading and\n\ncomprehension level of a third grader. In his report, Dr. Davis concludes:\n\n       Based upon my evaluation, it is my opinion, within reasonable scientific\n\n       certainty, that Mr. Barker\u2019s understanding and appreciation of an\n\n       important component of his Miranda Rights, specifically that [] his\n\n       appreciation of his right to an attorney, his right to remain silent, and\n\n       his ability to apply this right to an interrogation or court situation was\n\n       compromised when he was interrogated by police on 10.17.11.\n\n       {\u00b622} Also attached to Barker\u2019s petition was his postconviction counsel\u2019s\n\naffidavit in which she attests that she had not learned of the existence of the\n\nsuppression hearing until May 8, 2014. She then reviewed the transcript and consulted\n\nwith Dr. Davis on May 22, 2014. She attests that because the State had not yet filed a\n\nresponse, she chose to wait to file the amended petition after she had received Dr.\n\nDavis\u2019s report.\n\n       {\u00b623} In his Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate the dismissal of his first\n\npostconviction petition, Barker argued that the failure to amend his January 2014\n\npetition with a second ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim regarding the\n\nsuppression hearing, as well as Dr. Davis\u2019s reports, was due to excusable neglect. He\n\ncontended that his postconviction counsel acted in good faith by informing the\n\ncommon pleas court that the January 2014 petition would be amended to add a claim\n\nchallenging trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness at the suppression hearing and that an\n\namended petition would be filed as soon as the additional report from Dr. Davis was\n\nreceived. Further, postconviction counsel appears to argue that, because she filed the\n\nNotice, she did not believe it was necessary to request a stay of the petition while\n\nawaiting Dr. Davis\u2019s additional report.\n\n\n                                          10\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n        {\u00b624} These two pleadings\u2014the motion to vacate and the November 2014\n\npetition\u2014remained pending before the common pleas court for seven years. In June\n\n2021, the State filed responses to both. With respect to Barker\u2019s November 2014\n\npetition for postconviction relief, the State asked the court to dismiss the petition,\n\narguing that it was untimely and the petition did not meet the jurisdictional\n\nrequirements for a late or successive filing. See R.C. 2953.23(A). Regarding the motion\n\nto vacate, the State argued that Barker was merely trying to circumvent the filing\n\nrequirements for a petition for postconviction relief and that his failure to amend the\n\nJanuary 2014 petition to add the second claim and attach Dr. Davis\u2019s reports was not\n\nexcusable neglect, because Barker could have requested a stay but did not do so.\n\n        {\u00b625} In March 2023, following oral argument on both pleadings, the\n\ncommon pleas court granted Barker\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion and vacated the court\u2019s\n\nentry, which had dismissed Barker\u2019s January 2014 petition for postconviction relief\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing.2 The court then granted an \u201cevidentiary hearing on\n\n[Barker\u2019s] post conviction motion.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b626} The evidentiary hearing was held in the fall of 2023, and Barker\u2019s only\n\nargument at the hearing concerned his claim raised in his November 2014 petition\n\nthat his trial counsel was ineffective with respect to his suppression hearing. At the\n\nhearing, Barker presented the testimony of Dr. Davis, who testified that in preparing\n\nto evaluate Barker\u2019s ability to effectively waive his Miranda rights, he reviewed Dr.\n\nDeardorff\u2019s amenability report, the videotape and transcript of Barker\u2019s interrogation,\n\nand all the material he had from his own \u201creverse bindover evaluation\u201d of Barker,\n\n\n\n\n2 The State appealed the lower court\u2019s judgment vacating the dismissal of Barker\u2019s January 2014\n\npetition, but this court dismissed the appeal for lack of a final, appealable order by entry dated May\n25, 2023.\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nwhere he had reviewed Barker\u2019s school records and had interviewed Barker\u2019s mother\n\nand grandmother. Dr. Davis then evaluated Barker with the Weschler Adult\n\nIntelligence Scale Test (the \u201cWeschler IQ test\u201d) and the Miranda Rights\n\nComprehension Instrument (the \u201cMRCI\u201d). The Weschler IQ test confirmed Dr.\n\nDeardorff\u2019s testing that Barker\u2019s general intelligence level was in the second percentile,\n\nand that Barker had a reading comprehension level of a third grader. The MRCI\n\ndemonstrated that although Barker, in a formal test setting, had adequate\n\nunderstanding of \u201cMiranda vocabulary words,\u201d testing demonstrated that he did not\n\nknow how to apply the rights (or the meaning of those words) in an interrogation\n\nsetting. For example, Dr. Davis specifically noted that Barker could not appreciate his\n\nright to remain silent, as Barker consistently stated that he \u201chad to talk to the judge\n\nand the police\u201d and tell the truth. Dr. Davis also noted that Barker did not appreciate\n\nhis right to have an attorney present, as reflected in his comments to the detectives\n\nduring the second interrogation, that \u201che saw an attorney \u2013 whatever that is.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Dr. Davis opined that Barker\u2019s ability to appreciate his Miranda rights and\n\nunderstand the consequences of waiving them was compromised by his intellectual\n\ndisability.\n\n       {\u00b627} Following the evidentiary hearing, the common pleas court granted\n\nBarker\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, vacating his convictions and ordering a new\n\ntrial, including a new suppression hearing. In its findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw, the lower court found that Barker\u2019s trial counsel was defective in failing to attempt\n\nto challenge Barker\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights, especially since trial counsel had\n\naccess to Dr. Deardorff\u2019s amenability report, which indicated Barker\u2019s low-cognitive\n\nfunctioning, and could have introduced that report at the suppression hearing.\n\nFurther, the court found, given the report, it was deficient performance for trial\n\n\n                                           12\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\ncounsel not to investigate Barker\u2019s ability to competently waive his Miranda rights and\n\nhave him expertly evaluated using the MCRI and presenting those results at the\n\nsuppression hearing. Finally, the court found that given trial counsel\u2019s defective\n\nperformance at the suppression hearing, \u201cthe Court\u2019s confidence in the outcome of the\n\nsuppression hearing is undermined\u201d and concluded that Barker had received\n\nineffective assistance of trial counsel at his suppression hearing.\n\n        {\u00b628} The State now appeals, bringing forth two assignments of error\n\nchallenging the court\u2019s decision to vacate the judgment dismissing the January 2014\n\npetition and granting the petition for postconviction relief.\n\n                                          II. Analysis\n\n                           A. Civ.R. 60(B) Motion to Vacate\n\n        {\u00b629} In its first assignment of error, the State contends the common pleas\n\ncourt erred by granting Barker\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate the lower court\u2019s entry\n\ndismissing Barker\u2019s January 2014 petition for postconviction relief without an\n\nevidentiary hearing.3 We disagree.\n\n        {\u00b630} Before addressing the merits of the motion to vacate, we first consider\n\nthe State\u2019s argument that the common pleas court lacked authority to vacate the\n\ndismissal of Barker\u2019s petition, where this court had already affirmed that dismissal on\n\ndirect appeal. See Barker, 2016-Ohio-8476 (1st Dist.). In that appeal, we held that\n\nbecause Barker had neither amended his petition to include Dr. Davis\u2019s reports nor\n\nrequested a stay to permit such an amendment, the common pleas court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in dismissing the petition for postconviction relief, which had been\n\npending for six months. However, in reaching that holding, we did not specifically\n\n\n\n3 In its appeal, the State does not contest the applicability of Civ.R. 60(B) to vacate a judgment\n\ndenying a petition for postconviction relief.\n\n\n                                                13\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\naddress whether the Notice, together with postconviction counsel\u2019s affidavit\n\ndescribing efforts to obtain a second report from Dr. Davis concerning Barker\u2019s\n\ncompetency to waive his right against self-incrimination, constituted excusable\n\nneglect because the question of excusable neglect was not an issue in that case.\n\nAccordingly, in ruling on the motion to vacate, the lower court was not revisiting an\n\nissue already decided by this court. We therefore proceed to the merits of the motion\n\nto vacate.\n\n       {\u00b631} In order to prevail on a motion to vacate a judgment pursuant to Civ.R.\n\n60(B), the movant must demonstrate that (1) the party has a meritorious claim or\n\ndefense to present if relief is granted, (2) the party is entitled to relief under one of the\n\ngrounds stated in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5), and (3) the motion is made within a\n\nreasonable time, and where the grounds of relief are Civ.R. 60(B)(1), (2), or (3), not\n\nmore than one year after the judgment. GTE Automatic Elec. Co., Inc. v. ARC\n\nIndustries, Inc., 47 Ohio St.2d 146 (1976), paragraph two of the syllabus. We review\n\nthe grant of a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for abuse of discretion. Id. at 148.\n\n       {\u00b632} Civ.R. 60(B)(1) provides that a party may be relieved from a final\n\njudgment for \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d On appeal, the\n\nState takes issue with the lower court\u2019s finding that Barker had demonstrated he was\n\nentitled to relief on the ground of \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d which was postconviction\n\ncounsel\u2019s failure to either attach Dr. Davis\u2019s reports to the January 2014 petition prior\n\nto its dismissal or request a stay or leave to amend his petition after the State had\n\nresponded to Barker\u2019s petition.\n\n       {\u00b633} Excusable neglect is often explained by what it is not. For example, \u201ca\n\nparty\u2019s inaction is not excusable neglect when it shows \u2018a complete disregard for the\n\njudicial system\u2019 or when the party\u2019s conduct falls substantially below what is\n\n\n                                             14\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nreasonable under the circumstances.\u201d Kidz Bop LLC v. Broadhead, 2015-Ohio-3744,\n\n\u00b6 11 (1st Dist.), citing State ex rel. Jackson v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., 2014-Ohio-\n\n2353, \u00b6 23-25, and Heard v. Dubose, 2007-Ohio-551, \u00b6 19 (1st Dist.). After reviewing\n\nthe record in this case, we cannot say that Barker\u2019s postconviction counsel showed a\n\n\u201ccomplete disregard for the judicial system\u201d or that counsel\u2019s conduct fell substantially\n\nbelow what was reasonable under the circumstances. The suppression hearing and the\n\ndenial of the suppression motion were never docketed in the court\u2019s journal, however,\n\nas soon as postconviction counsel learned about the hearing, she immediately\n\nconsulted with Dr. Davis, and then filed the Notice, informing the court and the State\n\nthat the petition was going to be amended to add an additional claim. The Notice also\n\nexplained that postconviction counsel was in the process of securing an additional\n\nevaluation and report from Dr. Davis as to whether Barker had competently waived\n\nhis Miranda rights. Filing the Notice instead of requesting a stay was not unreasonable\n\ngiven that the State had not yet answered the petition, even though the petition had\n\nbeen filed and served on the State five months earlier. Finally, given that counsel,\n\nalbeit erroneously, believed that the Notice was sufficient to apprise the court that the\n\nreport would be filed shortly, we cannot say counsel\u2019s failure to then request a stay\n\nafter the State filed its answer fell substantially below reasonable conduct.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that\n\nBarker demonstrated that he was entitled to relief based on excusable neglect.\n\n       {\u00b634} The State does not challenge the other two elements of the Civ.R.\n\n60(B) motion, and we conclude that they were met. Barker filed his motion within five\n\nmonths of the court\u2019s judgment dismissing his January 2014 postconviction petition,\n\nwell within the one-year time period, and he had a meritorious claim to present:\n\nineffective assistance of counsel at his suppression hearing.\n\n\n                                           15\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b635} Accordingly, we hold that the common pleas court did not err in\n\ngranting Barker\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate the court\u2019s entry dismissing his\n\nJanuary 2014 petition for postconviction relief. The State\u2019s first assignment of error\n\nis overruled.\n\n                       B. Petition for Postconviction Relief\n\n       {\u00b636} In its second and final assignment of error, the State contends the court\n\nabused its discretion by granting Barker\u2019s petition for postconviction relief because the\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition or because Barker failed to present\n\nsubstantive grounds for relief. To prevail on a postconviction claim, the petitioner\n\nmust demonstrate a denial or infringement of his rights in the proceedings resulting\n\nin his conviction that rendered the conviction void or voidable under the state or\n\nfederal constitution. R.C. 2953.21(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b637} The State first argues the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the\n\npetition because it was untimely. At the time Barker filed his November 2014 petition\n\nfor postconviction relief, former R.C. 2953.21(H) required a petitioner to file a petition\n\nwithin 180 days from the date the transcript of proceedings was filed in the petitioner\u2019s\n\ndirect appeal. Here, Barker filed the final transcript on May 27, 2014, making\n\nNovember 24, 2014, the deadline. Because Barker filed his petition on November 21,\n\n2014, it was timely.\n\n       {\u00b638} Next, the State argues that even if Barker\u2019s petition was timely, it\n\nconstituted a successive petition and, because it failed to meet the jurisdictional\n\nrequirements of R.C. 2953.23(A), the lower court lacked jurisdiction to consider it. We\n\ndisagree. Barker was not required to satisfy R.C. 2953.23(A)\u2019s jurisdictional\n\nrequirements because the common pleas court had already granted his Civ.R. 60(B)\n\nmotion to vacate the dismissal of his January 2014 petition, which was once again\n\n\n                                            16\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\npending before the court. The common pleas court properly treated Barker\u2019s \u201csecond\u201d\n\npetition as an amendment to his original January 2014 petition; therefore, it was not\n\na successive petition. The amended petition was set for an evidentiary hearing, during\n\nwhich the record reflects that Barker abandoned his claim that trial counsel was\n\nineffective at the amenability hearing and proceeded solely on his claim of ineffective\n\nassistance at the suppression hearing. We now turn to the common pleas court\u2019s\n\nconsideration of that claim on the merits.\n\n       {\u00b639} A common pleas court\u2019s decision granting a petition for postconviction\n\nrelief will be upheld absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Gondor, 2006-Ohio-6679,\n\n\u00b6 58. \u201cA reviewing court should not overrule the trial court\u2019s finding on a petition for\n\npostconviction relief that is supported by competent, credible evidence.\u201d Id.\n\n       {\u00b640} The State argues that Barker did not present substantive grounds for\n\nrelief with respect to his postconviction claim challenging the effectiveness of his trial\n\ncounsel at his motion to suppress. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of trial\n\ncounsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a\n\npostconviction petitioner must demonstrate (1) that counsel\u2019s performance fell below\n\nan objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance\n\nprejudiced him. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984).\n\n       {\u00b641} Turning to the first prong of the Strickland test, the trial court found\n\nthat trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate whether Barker could properly waive his\n\nMiranda rights given his intellectual disability, including consulting with an expert,\n\nand counsel\u2019s failure to, at the very least, submit Dr. Deardorff\u2019s amenability report\n\ndemonstrating Barker\u2019s intellectual disability, fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness. We agree. Trial counsel had Dr. Deardorff\u2019s amenability report\n\nindicating Barker\u2019s borderline intelligence and third-grade reading level. Despite\n\n\n                                             17\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nhaving information that Barker may not have been able to intelligently waive his\n\nMiranda rights, trial counsel failed to investigate the matter further and hire defense\u2019s\n\nown expert to determine whether Barker could effectively waive his rights.\n\n       {\u00b642} The State contends that trial counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient\n\nbecause Barker\u2019s eventual testing with the MRCI reflected average scores in each\n\nsection. However, Dr. Davis explained that although the MRCI results showed Barker\n\nhad an adequate understanding of Miranda vocabulary in a formal testing\n\nenvironment, they also demonstrated that he lacked the ability to apply those terms\u2014\n\nor to exercise his rights appropriately\u2014during an actual interrogation. Dr. Davis\n\nfurther opined that Barker\u2019s intellectual disability impaired his ability to appreciate\n\nhis Miranda rights and understand the consequences of waiving them. Accordingly,\n\ngiven the expert testimony, competent, credible evidence supports the common pleas\n\ncourt\u2019s finding that trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate Barker\u2019s capacity to knowingly\n\nand intelligently waive his Miranda rights constituted deficient performance.\n\n       {\u00b643} Next, the common pleas court found, with respect to the prejudice\n\nprong of Strickland, that its confidence in the outcome of the suppression hearing was\n\nundermined. Although the State did not address prejudice in its appellate brief, relying\n\ninstead on its argument that trial counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient, we must\n\nnonetheless consider prejudice in determining whether the common pleas court\n\nproperly granted the petition.\n\n       {\u00b644} Under an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel analysis, \u201c[p]rejudice from\n\ndefective representation sufficient to justify a reversal exists only where the result of\n\nthe proceedings was unreliable or fundamentally unfair because of counsel\u2019s\n\nperformance.\u201d State v. Ross, 2024-Ohio-3117, \u00b6 37, citing Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506\n\nU.S. 364 (1993), and State v. Carter, 1995-Ohio-104. In cases where trial counsel is\n\n\n                                           18\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nalleged to have been deficient for failing to file a motion to suppress or raise a\n\nmeritorious argument in support of suppression, the court must determine if the\n\nmotion to suppress would have probably been granted. State v. Rosemond, 2019-\n\nOhio-5356, \u00b6 34 (1st Dist.).\n\n        {\u00b645} In the context of a plea-bargain case, the United States Supreme Court\n\nheld that the prejudice inquiry under Strickland requires a defendant to \u201cshow that\n\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have\n\npleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S.\n\n52, 59 (1985). As the United States Supreme Court explained in Premo v. Moore, 562\n\nU.S. 115, 129, 131-132 (2011), citing Hill, and as the Ohio Supreme Court recognized in\n\nState v. Bird, 81 Ohio St.3d 582, 585 (1998), a defendant who pleads guilty or no\n\ncontest must demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he\n\nwould not have entered his plea and insisted on going to trial. Thus, the prejudice\n\ninquiry in this case must also focus on whether trial counsel\u2019s constitutionally-\n\ndeficient performance at the suppression hearing affected the outcome of the plea\n\nprocess\u2014specifically, whether Barker has shown a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel\u2019s errors at the suppression hearing, his motion to suppress would have been\n\ngranted and he would not have entered no-contest pleas and would have elected to go\n\nto trial.\n\n        {\u00b646} Determining whether Barker would have not entered his pleas and\n\ninsisted on going to trial requires consideration of the other evidence, aside from\n\nBarker\u2019s inculpatory statements, that could demonstrate his commission of the\n\ncharged offenses. For example, if there is DNA evidence connecting Barker to the\n\ncrimes, he might still have opted to enter no-contest or guilty pleas. Conversely, if the\n\nonly evidence consisted of witness testimony connecting Barker to the offenses, he\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nmay have been more likely to take the risk of proceeding to trial.\n\n       {\u00b647} Here, the common pleas court did not apply the correct prejudice\n\nanalysis in determining that Barker had received ineffective assistance at his\n\nsuppression hearing. Accordingly, we remand the cause to the trial court to conduct\n\nthe appropriate prejudice inquiry and determine whether trial counsel\u2019s deficient\n\nperformance at the suppression hearing prejudiced Barker. The lower court\u2019s prior\n\nfinding that its confidence in the suppression hearing was undermined was\n\ninsufficient because the court failed to consider whether Barker, if the suppression\n\nmotion had been granted, would have declined to enter no-contest pleas and insisted\n\non proceeding to trial. Because the court did not engage in the correct prejudice\n\nanalysis, we reverse the judgment granting Barker\u2019s petition and remand the cause for\n\nfurther proceedings. On remand, the court may review the record or hold an additional\n\nevidentiary hearing to determine whether Barker would have entered his pleas given\n\nthe other evidence the State would have presented to support the charged offenses.\n\n       {\u00b648} Having determined that the common pleas court had jurisdiction to\n\nconsider Barker\u2019s amended petition for postconviction relief and that the court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in finding that trial counsel\u2019s performance at the suppression\n\nhearing was deficient, we overrule the State\u2019s second assignment of error in part. We\n\nsustain the second assignment, however, to the extent that the common pleas court\n\nfailed to apply the proper prejudice analysis. Accordingly, we remand the cause to the\n\ncommon pleas court to consider the prejudice prong of Strickland as it relates to\n\nBarker\u2019s claim that his trial counsel\u2019s deficient performance at the suppression hearing\n\nprejudiced him, considering whether, if Barker\u2019s statements had been suppressed,\n\nBarker would have declined to enter pleas and insisted on going to trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n                                 III. Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b649} Based on the foregoing, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment granting\n\nBarker\u2019s postconviction petition, and we remand the cause to the common pleas court\n\nto consider the prejudice inquiry under Strickland consistent with this opinion and\n\nthe law.

Barker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2025-Ohio-5251</span><pre class=\"inline\">.]\n\n\nMOORE, Judge.\n\n        {\u00b61}     Plaintiff-appellant, the State of Ohio, appeals the judgment of the\n\nHamilton County Court of Common Pleas granting defendant-appellee Tyshawn\n\nBarker\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. In his petition, Barker sought to vacate his\n\nconvictions for two counts of aggravated murder, three counts of tampering with\n\nevidence, and two counts of aggravated robbery because his trial counsel had been\n\nconstitutionally ineffective regarding Barker\u2019s motion to suppress his statements to\n\npolice. While we hold that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in determining\n\nthat Barker\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the common pleas court failed\n\nto engage in the appropriate analysis to determine whether Barker had been\n\nprejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance. We also hold that the common pleas\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by vacating the dismissal of Barker\u2019s January 2014\n\npetition. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in part and remand the\n\ncause for the common pleas court to apply the appropriate prejudice analysis. The\n\nlower court\u2019s judgment is affirmed in all other respects.\n\n                          I. Factual and Procedural History\n\n        {\u00b62}     This is the fourth time that this case has been before this court. We\n\nbriefly summarized the details of the offenses in a previous decision as follows:\n\n        Mr. Barker, Dequantez Nixon, Brendan Washington and Carrielle Conn\n\n        went to an apartment intending to kill one man but murdered a different\n\n        man who had the bad luck to answer the door. Ms. Conn was the shooter\n\n        in the first murder. Worried that Conn might snitch, her three\n\n        companions lured her into the woods and killed her two days later.\n\nState v. Barker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4076358\"><a href=\"/opinion/4299097/state-v-barker/#3\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State v. Barker\">2016-Ohio-7059, \u00b6 3</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Dist.).\n\n        {\u00b63}     Shortly before midnight, the day after Conn was murdered, 15-year-old\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nBarker was questioned about the shootings at police headquarters by Cincinnati Police\n\nDetectives Kurt Ballman and Terry McGuffey. Another suspect in the shootings,\n\nNixon, had implicated Barker during questioning earlier in the evening, and Barker\n\nwas found at Nixon\u2019s apartment when police were executing a search warrant.\n\n       {\u00b64}   The detectives began Barker\u2019s questioning by asking Barker\u2019s name,\n\naddress, phone number, age, mother\u2019s name, and where he went to school, whether he\n\ncould read and write, and whether he had consumed any alcohol or drugs. Detective\n\nBallman then read the Miranda warnings to Barker\u2014that he had the right to remain\n\nsilent, that anything he said could be used as evidence against him, and that he had\n\nthe right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed if he could not\n\nafford one. Barker told the detectives that he understood his rights, but when asked if\n\nhe had heard of Miranda warnings before, he replied that this was his \u201cfirst time.\u201d\n\nWhen questioned further, Barker stated that he had previously heard Miranda\n\nwarnings read on television.\n\n       {\u00b65}   The detectives then continued their interrogation without asking Barker\n\nwhether he wanted to continue or speak with an attorney, and Barker made statements\n\nimplicating himself in the shootings.\n\n       {\u00b66}   The next day, the two detectives visited Barker at the juvenile detention\n\nfacility. After Detective Ballman informed Barker that he was going to read the\n\nMiranda warnings to him again, Barker stated, \u201cI\u2019ve seen an attorney \u2013 whatever that\n\nis.\u201d This time Barker was asked whether he wanted to continue speaking with police\n\nor talk to his attorney, and Barker chose to continue. He then identified Washington\n\nfrom a picture and the interview ended.\n\n                                 A. Juvenile Court\n\n       {\u00b67}   Barker was eventually charged in juvenile court with various offenses\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nrelated to the shootings. After the juvenile court determined that there was probable\n\ncause that Barker had participated in the charged offenses, Barker was evaluated by\n\nDr. Paul Deardorff, a court-appointed psychologist, who offered an opinion on\n\nwhether Barker was amenable to rehabilitation in the juvenile court system. In his\n\nreport, he stated that there were several factors that indicated that Barker should not\n\nbe bound over to adult court, including:\n\n       his age, lack of prior history of involvement with the mental health\n\n       system, minimal involvement with the Juvenile Court system, minimal\n\n       attempts to treat or rehabilitate, a strong relationship with his mother,\n\n       exposure to abuse, the deaths of many relatives and one friend, his\n\n       special education background which includes an IEP, an apparent\n\n       history of ridicule, and his limited intellect.\n\n       {\u00b68}    Dr. Deardorff described Barker\u2019s intellect as borderline or \u201cmildly\n\nmentally retarded.\u201d Despite the factors indicating that Barker should not be\n\ntransferred to adult court, Dr. Deardorff explained in the report that he thought the\n\ncourt needed to balance those factors with the \u201cvery serious nature\u201d of the charges.\n\n       {\u00b69}    Following the amenability hearing, at which Dr. Deardorff did not\n\ntestify but his report was considered, the juvenile court determined that Barker was\n\nnot amenable to rehabilitation in the juvenile court system and transferred his case to\n\nadult court.\n\n                            B. Adult-Court Proceedings\n\n       {\u00b610} After being transferred to adult court, Barker and his codefendants,\n\nNixon and Washington, were each charged with four counts of aggravated murder, two\n\ncounts of conspiracy, two counts of aggravated robbery, and three counts of tampering\n\nwith evidence, all with gun and witness specifications. Barker filed a motion to\n\n\n                                             5\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nsuppress his statements to police, arguing that he did not knowingly, intelligently, or\n\nvoluntarily waive his Miranda rights. Nixon and Washington also filed motions to\n\nsuppress their individual statements, and a joint hearing was held on the motions. At\n\nthe hearing, Detective Ballman testified as to how each defendant was developed as a\n\nsuspect. On cross-examination by Barker\u2019s counsel, Detective Ballman conceded he\n\ndid not ask Barker detailed questions about his intellect, such as whether he was in\n\nany specialized educational program, but testified that he had no reason to believe that\n\nBarker did not understand the questions or the ongoing conversation during Barker\u2019s\n\npolice interview. Video and audio recordings of the police interrogation of each suspect\n\nwere admitted into evidence.\n\n        {\u00b611} A few days after the hearing, the trial court denied the motions to\n\nsuppress from the bench, but the entry denying Barker\u2019s motion was never entered on\n\nthe docket. Additionally, the entry setting Barker\u2019s motion for a hearing was also not\n\ndocketed.\n\n        {\u00b612} In February 2013, Barker entered into an agreement with the State\n\nwhere the State agreed to dismiss the two conspiracy counts and several of the\n\nspecifications to other counts in exchange for Barker entering a no-contest plea to each\n\nof the remaining offenses. At the plea hearing, the State read into the record the\n\noffenses against Barker as set forth in the indictment. Barker pled no-contest to each\n\noffense and was found guilty. The following month, a joint sentencing hearing was\n\nheld for all three defendants. Barker was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 25\n\nyears to life.\n\n                                  C. Direct Appeal\n\n        {\u00b613} We affirmed Barker\u2019s convictions on direct appeal, overruling\n\nassignments of error challenging (1) his transfer to adult court, (2) the denial of his\n\n\n                                           6\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nmotion to suppress, and (3) counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness at the amenability and motion-\n\nto-suppress hearings.

We briefly note that\n\nBarker\u2019s assignment of error as to his motion to suppress was raised after Barker\u2019s\n\nappellate counsel sought leave of court to raise an additional assignment of error,\n\nexplaining that she had been unaware that a suppression hearing had occurred and\n\nthat Barker\u2019s suppression motion had been denied because there were no entries on\n\nthe docket.\n\n       {\u00b614} The Ohio Supreme Court reversed our judgment in Barker\u2019s direct\n\nappeal because, in determining that Barker had knowingly waived his Miranda rights,\n\nwe referenced an Ohio statute, R.C. 2933.81(B), which creates a presumption that\n\nelectronically-recorded statements by suspects of certain crimes are voluntary.

Postconviction Proceedings\n\n       {\u00b616} In January 2014, while his direct appeal was pending, Barker filed a\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\npetition to vacate or set aside his convictions under R.C. 2953.21. In his petition,\n\nBarker asserted that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing \u201cto investigate and\n\nprepare a case to establish that [Barker] was amenable to rehabilitation in the juvenile\n\njustice system.\u201d Specifically, Barker claimed that his trial counsel should have called\n\nDr. Deardorff as a witness at the amenability hearing and should have had Barker\n\nevaluated by defense\u2019s own expert to show that his age and cognitive impairment\n\nlimited his culpability. Within the petition, Barker indicated that he intended to\n\namend the petition with the report and affidavit of an independent forensic\n\npsychologist and was in the process of securing those services.\n\n       {\u00b617} Four months later, Barker filed a pleading entitled \u201cInformation to\n\nCourt Regarding Amended Petition to Vacate or Set Aside Conviction under R.C.\n\n2953.21\u201d (\u201cthe Notice\u201d). In the Notice, postconviction counsel informed the court that\n\nDr. Daniel L. Davis, board certified in forensic psychology and specializing in\n\njuveniles, had evaluated and prepared a report regarding Barker\u2019s amenability to\n\nrehabilitation in juvenile court. However, postconviction counsel explained that she\n\nhad just recently discovered that a motion to suppress had been filed (and denied\n\nfollowing a hearing) in Barker\u2019s case. Counsel explained that because an entry denying\n\nthe motion to suppress had never been docketed, she was unaware of those\n\nproceedings. Consequently, postconviction counsel notified the court that Dr. Davis\n\nwas now also going to evaluate Barker as to whether he had the ability to effectively\n\nwaive his Miranda rights given his low-cognitive functioning. Postconviction counsel\n\nstated that the amended petition would be filed, which would include an additional\n\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim related to Barker\u2019s motion to suppress his\n\nstatements, after both reports had been received from Dr. Davis.\n\n       {\u00b618} Two weeks later, on May 30, 2014, the State filed a memorandum in\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nopposition to Barker\u2019s petition, arguing that Barker had not presented substantive\n\ngrounds for relief. Specifically, the State noted that there was no evidence attached to\n\nthe petition to demonstrate trial counsel had failed to investigate Barker\u2019s amenability\n\nto rehabilitation nor was there a report by an expert demonstrating that Barker\u2019s\n\ncognitive limitations and age made him amenable to rehabilitation. Two weeks after\n\nthe State\u2019s filing, the common pleas court dismissed Barker\u2019s petition.\n\n        {\u00b619} We affirmed the dismissal1 of Barker\u2019s petition on appeal, holding that\n\nthere was no evidence attached to Barker\u2019s petition to \u201cdemonstrate an outcome-\n\ndeterminative deficiency in his counsel\u2019s performance at the [amenability] hearing.\u201d\n\nState v.

Id. at \u00b6 24.\n\n        {\u00b620} In November 2014, Barker filed two pleadings: a petition for\n\npostconviction relief and a Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate the common pleas court\u2019s\n\nJune 2014 dismissal of his January 2014 petition for postconviction relief.\n\n        {\u00b621} In his November 2014 petition, Barker sets forth one claim: his trial\n\ncounsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to investigate and present evidence\n\nof his low intelligence and cognitive delays at the suppression hearing and, specifically,\n\nfor failing to have Barker evaluated by a forensic psychologist with the Miranda Rights\n\nComprehension Instrument and presenting those test results at the suppression\n\nhearing. In support of his petition, Barker attached Dr. Davis\u2019s curriculum vitae and\n\nhis evaluation report, which indicated that Barker has a full-scale IQ score of 70, which\n\n\n\n\n1 Although the common pleas court\u2019s entry indicates that it is \u201cdismissing\u201d Barker\u2019s January 2014\n\npetition, in the direct appeal from that judgment, this court referred to the lower court\u2019s judgment\nas \u201cdenying\u201d the petition.\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nis in the second percentile, indicating an intellectual disability, and a reading and\n\ncomprehension level of a third grader. In his report, Dr. Davis concludes:\n\n       Based upon my evaluation, it is my opinion, within reasonable scientific\n\n       certainty, that Mr. Barker\u2019s understanding and appreciation of an\n\n       important component of his Miranda Rights, specifically that [] his\n\n       appreciation of his right to an attorney, his right to remain silent, and\n\n       his ability to apply this right to an interrogation or court situation was\n\n       compromised when he was interrogated by police on 10.17.11.\n\n       {\u00b622} Also attached to Barker\u2019s petition was his postconviction counsel\u2019s\n\naffidavit in which she attests that she had not learned of the existence of the\n\nsuppression hearing until May 8, 2014. She then reviewed the transcript and consulted\n\nwith Dr. Davis on May 22, 2014. She attests that because the State had not yet filed a\n\nresponse, she chose to wait to file the amended petition after she had received Dr.\n\nDavis\u2019s report.\n\n       {\u00b623} In his Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate the dismissal of his first\n\npostconviction petition, Barker argued that the failure to amend his January 2014\n\npetition with a second ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim regarding the\n\nsuppression hearing, as well as Dr. Davis\u2019s reports, was due to excusable neglect. He\n\ncontended that his postconviction counsel acted in good faith by informing the\n\ncommon pleas court that the January 2014 petition would be amended to add a claim\n\nchallenging trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness at the suppression hearing and that an\n\namended petition would be filed as soon as the additional report from Dr. Davis was\n\nreceived. Further, postconviction counsel appears to argue that, because she filed the\n\nNotice, she did not believe it was necessary to request a stay of the petition while\n\nawaiting Dr. Davis\u2019s additional report.\n\n\n                                          10\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n        {\u00b624} These two pleadings\u2014the motion to vacate and the November 2014\n\npetition\u2014remained pending before the common pleas court for seven years. In June\n\n2021, the State filed responses to both. With respect to Barker\u2019s November 2014\n\npetition for postconviction relief, the State asked the court to dismiss the petition,\n\narguing that it was untimely and the petition did not meet the jurisdictional\n\nrequirements for a late or successive filing. See R.C. 2953.23(A). Regarding the motion\n\nto vacate, the State argued that Barker was merely trying to circumvent the filing\n\nrequirements for a petition for postconviction relief and that his failure to amend the\n\nJanuary 2014 petition to add the second claim and attach Dr. Davis\u2019s reports was not\n\nexcusable neglect, because Barker could have requested a stay but did not do so.\n\n        {\u00b625} In March 2023, following oral argument on both pleadings, the\n\ncommon pleas court granted Barker\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion and vacated the court\u2019s\n\nentry, which had dismissed Barker\u2019s January 2014 petition for postconviction relief\n\nwithout an evidentiary hearing.2 The court then granted an \u201cevidentiary hearing on\n\n[Barker\u2019s] post conviction motion.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b626} The evidentiary hearing was held in the fall of 2023, and Barker\u2019s only\n\nargument at the hearing concerned his claim raised in his November 2014 petition\n\nthat his trial counsel was ineffective with respect to his suppression hearing. At the\n\nhearing, Barker presented the testimony of Dr. Davis, who testified that in preparing\n\nto evaluate Barker\u2019s ability to effectively waive his Miranda rights, he reviewed Dr.\n\nDeardorff\u2019s amenability report, the videotape and transcript of Barker\u2019s interrogation,\n\nand all the material he had from his own \u201creverse bindover evaluation\u201d of Barker,\n\n\n\n\n2 The State appealed the lower court\u2019s judgment vacating the dismissal of Barker\u2019s January 2014\n\npetition, but this court dismissed the appeal for lack of a final, appealable order by entry dated May\n25, 2023.\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nwhere he had reviewed Barker\u2019s school records and had interviewed Barker\u2019s mother\n\nand grandmother. Dr. Davis then evaluated Barker with the Weschler Adult\n\nIntelligence Scale Test (the \u201cWeschler IQ test\u201d) and the Miranda Rights\n\nComprehension Instrument (the \u201cMRCI\u201d). The Weschler IQ test confirmed Dr.\n\nDeardorff\u2019s testing that Barker\u2019s general intelligence level was in the second percentile,\n\nand that Barker had a reading comprehension level of a third grader. The MRCI\n\ndemonstrated that although Barker, in a formal test setting, had adequate\n\nunderstanding of \u201cMiranda vocabulary words,\u201d testing demonstrated that he did not\n\nknow how to apply the rights (or the meaning of those words) in an interrogation\n\nsetting. For example, Dr. Davis specifically noted that Barker could not appreciate his\n\nright to remain silent, as Barker consistently stated that he \u201chad to talk to the judge\n\nand the police\u201d and tell the truth. Dr. Davis also noted that Barker did not appreciate\n\nhis right to have an attorney present, as reflected in his comments to the detectives\n\nduring the second interrogation, that \u201che saw an attorney \u2013 whatever that is.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Dr. Davis opined that Barker\u2019s ability to appreciate his Miranda rights and\n\nunderstand the consequences of waiving them was compromised by his intellectual\n\ndisability.\n\n       {\u00b627} Following the evidentiary hearing, the common pleas court granted\n\nBarker\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, vacating his convictions and ordering a new\n\ntrial, including a new suppression hearing. In its findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw, the lower court found that Barker\u2019s trial counsel was defective in failing to attempt\n\nto challenge Barker\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights, especially since trial counsel had\n\naccess to Dr. Deardorff\u2019s amenability report, which indicated Barker\u2019s low-cognitive\n\nfunctioning, and could have introduced that report at the suppression hearing.\n\nFurther, the court found, given the report, it was deficient performance for trial\n\n\n                                           12\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\ncounsel not to investigate Barker\u2019s ability to competently waive his Miranda rights and\n\nhave him expertly evaluated using the MCRI and presenting those results at the\n\nsuppression hearing. Finally, the court found that given trial counsel\u2019s defective\n\nperformance at the suppression hearing, \u201cthe Court\u2019s confidence in the outcome of the\n\nsuppression hearing is undermined\u201d and concluded that Barker had received\n\nineffective assistance of trial counsel at his suppression hearing.\n\n        {\u00b628} The State now appeals, bringing forth two assignments of error\n\nchallenging the court\u2019s decision to vacate the judgment dismissing the January 2014\n\npetition and granting the petition for postconviction relief.\n\n                                          II. Analysis\n\n                           A. Civ.R. 60(B) Motion to Vacate\n\n        {\u00b629} In its first assignment of error, the State contends the common pleas\n\ncourt erred by granting Barker\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate the lower court\u2019s entry\n\ndismissing Barker\u2019s January 2014 petition for postconviction relief without an\n\nevidentiary hearing.3 We disagree.\n\n        {\u00b630} Before addressing the merits of the motion to vacate, we first consider\n\nthe State\u2019s argument that the common pleas court lacked authority to vacate the\n\ndismissal of Barker\u2019s petition, where this court had already affirmed that dismissal on\n\ndirect appeal. See Barker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4112327\"><a href=\"/opinion/4335066/state-v-barker/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State v. Barker\">2016-Ohio-8476</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Dist.). In that appeal, we held that\n\nbecause Barker had neither amended his petition to include Dr. Davis\u2019s reports nor\n\nrequested a stay to permit such an amendment, the common pleas court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in dismissing the petition for postconviction relief, which had been\n\npending for six months. However, in reaching that holding, we did not specifically\n\n\n\n3 In its appeal, the State does not contest the applicability of Civ.R. 60(B) to vacate a judgment\n\ndenying a petition for postconviction relief.\n\n\n                                                13\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\naddress whether the Notice, together with postconviction counsel\u2019s affidavit\n\ndescribing efforts to obtain a second report from Dr. Davis concerning Barker\u2019s\n\ncompetency to waive his right against self-incrimination, constituted excusable\n\nneglect because the question of excusable neglect was not an issue in that case.\n\nAccordingly, in ruling on the motion to vacate, the lower court was not revisiting an\n\nissue already decided by this court. We therefore proceed to the merits of the motion\n\nto vacate.\n\n       {\u00b631} In order to prevail on a motion to vacate a judgment pursuant to Civ.R.\n\n60(B), the movant must demonstrate that (1) the party has a meritorious claim or\n\ndefense to present if relief is granted, (2) the party is entitled to relief under one of the\n\ngrounds stated in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5), and (3) the motion is made within a\n\nreasonable time, and where the grounds of relief are Civ.R. 60(B)(1), (2), or (3), not\n\nmore than one year after the judgment.

After reviewing\n\nthe record in this case, we cannot say that Barker\u2019s postconviction counsel showed a\n\n\u201ccomplete disregard for the judicial system\u201d or that counsel\u2019s conduct fell substantially\n\nbelow what was reasonable under the circumstances. The suppression hearing and the\n\ndenial of the suppression motion were never docketed in the court\u2019s journal, however,\n\nas soon as postconviction counsel learned about the hearing, she immediately\n\nconsulted with Dr. Davis, and then filed the Notice, informing the court and the State\n\nthat the petition was going to be amended to add an additional claim. The Notice also\n\nexplained that postconviction counsel was in the process of securing an additional\n\nevaluation and report from Dr. Davis as to whether Barker had competently waived\n\nhis Miranda rights. Filing the Notice instead of requesting a stay was not unreasonable\n\ngiven that the State had not yet answered the petition, even though the petition had\n\nbeen filed and served on the State five months earlier. Finally, given that counsel,\n\nalbeit erroneously, believed that the Notice was sufficient to apprise the court that the\n\nreport would be filed shortly, we cannot say counsel\u2019s failure to then request a stay\n\nafter the State filed its answer fell substantially below reasonable conduct.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that\n\nBarker demonstrated that he was entitled to relief based on excusable neglect.\n\n       {\u00b634} The State does not challenge the other two elements of the Civ.R.\n\n60(B) motion, and we conclude that they were met. Barker filed his motion within five\n\nmonths of the court\u2019s judgment dismissing his January 2014 postconviction petition,\n\nwell within the one-year time period, and he had a meritorious claim to present:\n\nineffective assistance of counsel at his suppression hearing.\n\n\n                                           15\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b635} Accordingly, we hold that the common pleas court did not err in\n\ngranting Barker\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate the court\u2019s entry dismissing his\n\nJanuary 2014 petition for postconviction relief. The State\u2019s first assignment of error\n\nis overruled.\n\n                       B. Petition for Postconviction Relief\n\n       {\u00b636} In its second and final assignment of error, the State contends the court\n\nabused its discretion by granting Barker\u2019s petition for postconviction relief because the\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition or because Barker failed to present\n\nsubstantive grounds for relief. To prevail on a postconviction claim, the petitioner\n\nmust demonstrate a denial or infringement of his rights in the proceedings resulting\n\nin his conviction that rendered the conviction void or voidable under the state or\n\nfederal constitution. R.C. 2953.21(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b637} The State first argues the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the\n\npetition because it was untimely. At the time Barker filed his November 2014 petition\n\nfor postconviction relief, former R.C. 2953.21(H) required a petitioner to file a petition\n\nwithin 180 days from the date the transcript of proceedings was filed in the petitioner\u2019s\n\ndirect appeal. Here, Barker filed the final transcript on May 27, 2014, making\n\nNovember 24, 2014, the deadline. Because Barker filed his petition on November 21,\n\n2014, it was timely.\n\n       {\u00b638} Next, the State argues that even if Barker\u2019s petition was timely, it\n\nconstituted a successive petition and, because it failed to meet the jurisdictional\n\nrequirements of R.C. 2953.23(A), the lower court lacked jurisdiction to consider it. We\n\ndisagree. Barker was not required to satisfy R.C. 2953.23(A)\u2019s jurisdictional\n\nrequirements because the common pleas court had already granted his Civ.R. 60(B)\n\nmotion to vacate the dismissal of his January 2014 petition, which was once again\n\n\n                                            16\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\npending before the court. The common pleas court properly treated Barker\u2019s \u201csecond\u201d\n\npetition as an amendment to his original January 2014 petition; therefore, it was not\n\na successive petition. The amended petition was set for an evidentiary hearing, during\n\nwhich the record reflects that Barker abandoned his claim that trial counsel was\n\nineffective at the amenability hearing and proceeded solely on his claim of ineffective\n\nassistance at the suppression hearing. We now turn to the common pleas court\u2019s\n\nconsideration of that claim on the merits.\n\n       {\u00b639} A common pleas court\u2019s decision granting a petition for postconviction\n\nrelief will be upheld absent an abuse of discretion.

To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of trial\n\ncounsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a\n\npostconviction petitioner must demonstrate (1) that counsel\u2019s performance fell below\n\nan objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance\n\nprejudiced him. See Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9429592\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/#694\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Strickland v. Washington\">466 U.S. 668, 694</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984).\n\n       {\u00b641} Turning to the first prong of the Strickland test, the trial court found\n\nthat trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate whether Barker could properly waive his\n\nMiranda rights given his intellectual disability, including consulting with an expert,\n\nand counsel\u2019s failure to, at the very least, submit Dr. Deardorff\u2019s amenability report\n\ndemonstrating Barker\u2019s intellectual disability, fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness. We agree. Trial counsel had Dr. Deardorff\u2019s amenability report\n\nindicating Barker\u2019s borderline intelligence and third-grade reading level. Despite\n\n\n                                             17\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nhaving information that Barker may not have been able to intelligently waive his\n\nMiranda rights, trial counsel failed to investigate the matter further and hire defense\u2019s\n\nown expert to determine whether Barker could effectively waive his rights.\n\n       {\u00b642} The State contends that trial counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient\n\nbecause Barker\u2019s eventual testing with the MRCI reflected average scores in each\n\nsection. However, Dr. Davis explained that although the MRCI results showed Barker\n\nhad an adequate understanding of Miranda vocabulary in a formal testing\n\nenvironment, they also demonstrated that he lacked the ability to apply those terms\u2014\n\nor to exercise his rights appropriately\u2014during an actual interrogation. Dr. Davis\n\nfurther opined that Barker\u2019s intellectual disability impaired his ability to appreciate\n\nhis Miranda rights and understand the consequences of waiving them. Accordingly,\n\ngiven the expert testimony, competent, credible evidence supports the common pleas\n\ncourt\u2019s finding that trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate Barker\u2019s capacity to knowingly\n\nand intelligently waive his Miranda rights constituted deficient performance.\n\n       {\u00b643} Next, the common pleas court found, with respect to the prejudice\n\nprong of Strickland, that its confidence in the outcome of the suppression hearing was\n\nundermined. Although the State did not address prejudice in its appellate brief, relying\n\ninstead on its argument that trial counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient, we must\n\nnonetheless consider prejudice in determining whether the common pleas court\n\nproperly granted the petition.\n\n       {\u00b644} Under an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel analysis, \u201c[p]rejudice from\n\ndefective representation sufficient to justify a reversal exists only where the result of\n\nthe proceedings was unreliable or fundamentally unfair because of counsel\u2019s\n\nperformance.\u201d State v.

Thus, the prejudice\n\ninquiry in this case must also focus on whether trial counsel\u2019s constitutionally-\n\ndeficient performance at the suppression hearing affected the outcome of the plea\n\nprocess\u2014specifically, whether Barker has shown a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel\u2019s errors at the suppression hearing, his motion to suppress would have been\n\ngranted and he would not have entered no-contest pleas and would have elected to go\n\nto trial.\n\n        {\u00b646} Determining whether Barker would have not entered his pleas and\n\ninsisted on going to trial requires consideration of the other evidence, aside from\n\nBarker\u2019s inculpatory statements, that could demonstrate his commission of the\n\ncharged offenses. For example, if there is DNA evidence connecting Barker to the\n\ncrimes, he might still have opted to enter no-contest or guilty pleas. Conversely, if the\n\nonly evidence consisted of witness testimony connecting Barker to the offenses, he\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nmay have been more likely to take the risk of proceeding to trial.\n\n       {\u00b647} Here, the common pleas court did not apply the correct prejudice\n\nanalysis in determining that Barker had received ineffective assistance at his\n\nsuppression hearing. Accordingly, we remand the cause to the trial court to conduct\n\nthe appropriate prejudice inquiry and determine whether trial counsel\u2019s deficient\n\nperformance at the suppression hearing prejudiced Barker. The lower court\u2019s prior\n\nfinding that its confidence in the suppression hearing was undermined was\n\ninsufficient because the court failed to consider whether Barker, if the suppression\n\nmotion had been granted, would have declined to enter no-contest pleas and insisted\n\non proceeding to trial. Because the court did not engage in the correct prejudice\n\nanalysis, we reverse the judgment granting Barker\u2019s petition and remand the cause for\n\nfurther proceedings. On remand, the court may review the record or hold an additional\n\nevidentiary hearing to determine whether Barker would have entered his pleas given\n\nthe other evidence the State would have presented to support the charged offenses.\n\n       {\u00b648} Having determined that the common pleas court had jurisdiction to\n\nconsider Barker\u2019s amended petition for postconviction relief and that the court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in finding that trial counsel\u2019s performance at the suppression\n\nhearing was deficient, we overrule the State\u2019s second assignment of error in part. We\n\nsustain the second assignment, however, to the extent that the common pleas court\n\nfailed to apply the proper prejudice analysis. Accordingly, we remand the cause to the\n\ncommon pleas court to consider the prejudice prong of Strickland as it relates to\n\nBarker\u2019s claim that his trial counsel\u2019s deficient performance at the suppression hearing\n\nprejudiced him, considering whether, if Barker\u2019s statements had been suppressed,\n\nBarker would have declined to enter pleas and insisted on going to trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n                                 III. Conclusion\n\n       {\u00b649} Based on the foregoing, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment granting\n\nBarker\u2019s postconviction petition, and we remand the cause to the common pleas court\n\nto consider the prejudice inquiry under Strickland consistent with this opinion and\n\nthe law.

Harden, 2025-Ohio-5255.]\n\n\nBOCK, Judge.\n\n        {\u00b61}     Defendant-appellant Marcus Harden challenges the trial court\u2019s\n\njudgments, which denied his two petitions for postconviction relief from his 2004\n\nconviction for child endangerment. In five assignments of error, Harden maintains\n\nthat the trial court should have granted his petitions or held an evidentiary hearing on\n\nhis claims that his trial attorney\u2019s misrepresentation of his ability to expunge his\n\nconviction induced Harden to plead guilty.\n\n        {\u00b62}     We lack authority to reach the merits of Harden\u2019s claims because the\n\ntrial court lacked jurisdiction to consider Harden\u2019s untimely petitions. Harden was\n\nconvicted by guilty plea and cannot satisfy R.C. 2953.23(A)(2)\u2019s jurisdictional\n\nrequirement of demonstrating that, \u201cbut for the constitutional error at trial, no\n\nreasonable factfinder\u201d would have convicted Harden.\n\n        {\u00b63}     Therefore, we modify the trial court\u2019s judgments to dismissals and\n\naffirm the trial court\u2019s judgments as modified.\n\n                          I. Factual and Procedural History\n\nA. Harden\u2019s attorney\u2019s misconduct\n\n        {\u00b64}     In 2004, Harden hired attorney Kenneth Lawson to defend him against\n\nfelonious-assault and child-endangerment charges. According to Harden, he relied on\n\nLawson\u2019s legal advice in which Lawson represented to Harden that his conviction\n\nwould be eligible for expungement. Harden then pleaded guilty to one count of child\n\nendangerment, a second-degree felony. The trial court accepted Harden\u2019s plea and\n\nsentenced him to the agreed five-year term of community control. Harden did not file\n\na direct appeal. In 2009, Harden was discharged from community control.\n\n        {\u00b65}     Meanwhile, Lawson received an interim suspension from practicing law\n\nin 2007 due to allegations of \u201cnumerous violations of the Code of Professional\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nResponsibility and [the] substantial threat of serious harm [that he poses] to his clients\n\nand the public.\u201d Disciplinary Counsel v. Lawson, 113 Ohio St.3d 1508, 1508 (2007).\n\nThe claims against Lawson ranged from misappropriating his clients\u2019 funds to\n\nneglecting, or abandoning, his clients\u2019 cases. See Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Lawson,\n\n2008-Ohio-3340, \u00b6 66.\n\n       {\u00b66}   During the disciplinary proceedings, Lawson \u201cadmitted himself to a\n\nrehabilitation facility after more than seven years of drug abuse.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 5. Indeed,\n\nLawson\u2019s substance use had \u201cseverely compromised the interests of his clients, the\n\nlegal system, the legal profession, and the public.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 74. So, in 2008, the Supreme\n\nCourt of Ohio indefinitely suspended Lawson from practicing law. See id.\n\n       {\u00b67}   Later that year, Lawson pleaded guilty to federal charges of \u201cconspiracy\n\nto obtain Schedule II controlled substances by deception . . . between August 2003 and\n\n2007.\u201d Disciplinary Counsel v. Lawson, 2011-Ohio-4673, \u00b6 9. Lawson was using his\n\nattorney-client relationship to pressure his client, a physician, into prescribing him\n\nnarcotics. Id. at \u00b6 4-9. To avoid detection, Lawson instructed the physician to use\n\nLawson\u2019s clients\u2019 names for those prescriptions. Id. at \u00b6 7. After a second disciplinary\n\ncomplaint, in 2011 the Supreme Court of Ohio permanently disbarred Lawson from\n\npracticing law due to the extent of Lawson\u2019s conspiracy. Id. at \u00b6 36.\n\nB. Harden\u2019s postconviction petitions\n\n       {\u00b68}   In September 2024, Harden petitioned for postconviction relief under\n\nR.C. 2953.21, claiming that Lawson had provided constitutionally ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel by inducing Harden to plead guilty, not investigating Harden\u2019s\n\ncase, and misrepresenting to Harden that he could have his child-endangerment\n\nconviction expunged. In his petition, Harden pointed out that Lawson had admitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nduring a disciplinary hearing, to being under the influence of drugs when he\n\nencouraged his clients to accept plea offers from the State in 2004.\n\n       {\u00b69}     Harden explained that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering\n\nLawson\u2019s misconduct because it \u201cwas revealed 4 years after [Harden\u2019s] sentencing, by\n\ncounsel himself in his disciplinary hearing\u201d and Harden was advised in 2009 \u201cto wait\n\nthree years from being discharged\u201d to request expungement of his conviction. In\n\nsupport of his petition, Harden attached his criminal case docket, Lawson\u2019s\n\nsuspension and disbarment orders, and a letter from Harden\u2019s son on behalf of Harden\n\nproclaiming Harden\u2019s innocence in the child-endangerment matter. Weeks later,\n\nHarden moved for summary judgment on his petition.\n\n       {\u00b610} Then in January 2025, Harden filed an amended petition for\n\npostconviction relief to emphasize Lawson\u2019s efforts to convince Harden to plead guilty.\n\nIn support, he attached a notarized statement from his wife, the mother of the victim\n\nin   Harden\u2019s    child-endangerment    case.   Harden\u2019s   wife   described   Lawson\u2019s\n\nmisrepresentations about the consequences of a conviction for child endangerment,\n\nwhich heavily influenced Harden\u2019s decision to plead guilty.\n\n       {\u00b611} In February 2025, the trial court found Harden\u2019s petitions \u201cnot well\n\ntaken\u201d and denied the petitions.\n\n                                    II. Analysis\n\n       {\u00b612}    On appeal, Harden challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his\n\npostconviction petitions in five assignments of error. First, Harden argues that the\n\ntrial court should have found that Lawson\u2019s constitutionally-deficient legal assistance\n\ndeprived Harden of his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution. Second, he asserts that the trial court should have held an evidentiary\n\nhearing. Third, he maintains that Lawson\u2019s extreme and pervasive misconduct\n\n\n                                          5\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\namounted to a complete denial of counsel under United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648\n\n(1984). In his fourth and fifth assignments of error, Harden argues that Lawson\u2019s\n\ndeficient pretrial representation violated his constitutional right to trial under Hill v.\n\nLockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985), and Lee v. United States, 682 U.S. 357 (2017).\n\n       {\u00b613} Ohio\u2019s postconviction-relief statute, R.C. 2953.21, affords a person\n\nconvicted of a criminal offense an opportunity to mount a \u201ccollateral civil attack on the\n\njudgment.\u201d State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 283 (1999). Relief is available under\n\nR.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) if a petitioner can show \u201cthat there was a denial or infringement\n\nof the person\u2019s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio\n\nConstitution or Constitution of the United States.\u201d R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a)(i).\n\n       {\u00b614} Ordinarily, we review the trial court\u2019s decision to deny a postconviction\n\npetition for an abuse of discretion. See State v. Hatton, 2022-Ohio-3991, \u00b6 38.\n\nHowever, Harden\u2019s postconviction petitions raise a threshold jurisdictional issue that\n\nwe review de novo. Id.\n\nA. Jurisdiction under Ohio\u2019s postconviction-relief statute\n\n       {\u00b615} Ohio\u2019s postconviction statute limits a trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to\n\nconsider untimely postconviction petitions. See State v. Apanovitch, 2018-Ohio-4744,\n\n\u00b6 36, quoting R.C. 2953.23(A); see also State v. Chamblin, 2023-Ohio-3129, \u00b6 6 (1st\n\nDist.). Relevant here, the statute requires petitioners to file their postconviction\n\npetitions \u201cno later than three hundred sixty-five days after the expiration of the time\n\nfor filing the appeal.\u201d R.C. 2953.21(A)(2)(a).\n\n       {\u00b616} For postconviction petitions filed beyond that timeframe, a petitioner\n\n\u201cmust satisfy the jurisdictional requirements in R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) or (2).\u201d Hatton at\n\n\u00b6 37. First, under R.C. 2953.23(A)(2), a trial court has jurisdiction to consider untimely\n\npetitions involving cases of \u201cactual innocence as a result of DNA testing.\u201d\n\n\n                                            6\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b617} Second, and alternatively, a trial court has jurisdiction under R.C.\n\n2953.23(A)(1) to consider an untimely postconviction petition when the petitioner\n\nsatisfies the statute\u2019s two-part test. A petitioner must produce evidence that both (1)\n\nshows he was either \u201cunavoidably prevented\u201d from discovering the factual basis for his\n\nconstitutional error, or that his petition relies on a new federal or state right recognized\n\nby the United States Supreme Court, which applies retroactively to his claims, and (2)\n\nclearly and convincingly proves \u201cthat, but for constitutional error at trial, no\n\nreasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which\n\nthe petitioner was convicted.\u201d R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a) and (b).\n\nB. Harden cannot satisfy the jurisdictional two-part test\n\n       {\u00b618} Harden\u2019s deadline for filing a postconviction petition ran in 2005.\n\nHarden concedes that his 2024 petitions were untimely, but he argues that the trial\n\ncourt had jurisdiction to consider his petitions under R.C. 2953.23(A).\n\n       {\u00b619} Because Harden did not have postconviction DNA testing performed,\n\nthe trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider his postconviction petitions unless he\n\nsatisfied the two-part test under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1). And Harden does not allege that\n\na new federal or state right applies retroactively to his case. As a result, the trial court\u2019s\n\njurisdiction to entertain the petitions hinged on whether Harden met both factors: \u201c(1)\n\nwas unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts on which he must rely to\n\npresent his claim for relief and (2) . . . but for constitutional error at trial, no\n\nreasonable fact-finder would have found him guilty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Hatton,\n\n2022-Ohio-3991, at \u00b6 39.\n\n       {\u00b620} Harden and the State contest whether Harden could have discovered\n\nLawson\u2019s misconduct. Harden cites the fact that Lawson\u2019s misconduct became known\n\nin 2009, well past his 365-day deadline under R.C. 2953.21(A)(2)(a). For its part, the\n\n\n                                              7\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nState cites Harden\u2019s post-deadline delay, from 2012 to 2024, to argue that the trial\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction over his petitions.1\n\n        {\u00b621} But we need not reach this question because Harden pleaded guilty to\n\nthe endangerment charge. As such, his petitions cannot show that, absent the alleged\n\n\u201cconstitutional error at trial,\u201d no reasonable juror would have convicted him. See R.C.\n\n2953.23(A)(2). Most Ohio courts have held that R.C. 2953.23(A)(2) is unavailable for\n\nuntimely petitions challenging a conviction based on a guilty plea. See State v. Moon,\n\n2015-Ohio-1550, \u00b6 33 (8th Dist.) (\u201c[T]his court and others have previously held that\n\nwhere a defendant enters a guilty plea, R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b) \u2014 requiring a defendant\n\nto establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have\n\nfound him guilty but for constitutional error at trial\u2014does not apply.\u201d); see also State\n\nv. Estridge, 2006-Ohio-5310, \u00b6 8 (2d Dist.); State v. Smith, 2005-Ohio-4910, \u00b6 25 (4th\n\nDist.); State v. Clark, 2008-Ohio-194, \u00b6 18 (5th Dist.); State v. Davis, 2022-Ohio-\n\n4767, \u00b6 28-29 (6th Dist.); State v. Demyan, 2012-Ohio-3634, \u00b6 4 (9th Dist.); State v.\n\nHairston, 2013-Ohio-3834, \u00b6 8 (10th Dist.); State v. Pough, 2004-Ohio-3933, \u00b6 17\n\n(11th Dist.); State v. Coleman, 2023-Ohio-4354, \u00b6 29 (12th Dist.).\n\n        {\u00b622} As some courts have explained, absent a trial and a record of the\n\nevidence used to convict the defendant, a court considering a postconviction\n\npetition cannot determine if no reasonable factfinder would have found the defendant\n\nguilty. See Moon at \u00b6 34 (collecting cases). The Moon court recognized an exception to\n\nthis general rule for ineffective-assistance claims based on counsel\u2019s failure to file a\n\n\n\n\n1 Ohio courts describing a petitioner\u2019s burden under R.C. 2923(A)(1)(b) often ask whether the\n\npetitioner \u201cwas unavoidably prevented from discovering [the relevant fact] within the statutory\ndeadline.\u201d State v. Johnson, 2024-Ohio-134, \u00b6 30; see State v. Howard, 2016-Ohio-504, \u00b6 35 (10th\nDist.); see also State v. Montgomery, 2016-Ohio-7527, \u00b6 52 (6th Dist); State v. Brown, 2022-Ohio-\n519, \u00b6 11 (4th Dist.).\n\n\n                                               8\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nmotion to suppress that, if granted, would have excluded all of the State\u2019s evidence\n\nfrom trial. Id. at \u00b6 36. But those circumstances are not present here.\n\n        {\u00b623} Harden compares his petitions to actions filed by one of Lawson\u2019s other\n\nclients who sought relief from their convictions based on Lawson\u2019s misrepresentations\n\nduring plea bargaining. See State v. Smith, 2008-Ohio-3789, \u00b6 27 (1st Dist.). In Smith,\n\nthis court held that the record supported Smith\u2019s postconviction claim that Lawson\u2019s\n\nmisrepresentations resulted in Smith entering a no-contest plea that was involuntary,\n\nwarranting an evidentiary hearing on Smith\u2019s claims. Id. at \u00b6 25. But Smith did not file\n\nan untimely petition and did not have to clear R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b)\u2019s hurdle of\n\nshowing that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.2\n\n        {\u00b624} In sum, we hold that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain\n\nHarden\u2019s untimely petitions because he is unable to satisfy R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b), as\n\nHarden was convicted by plea. Rather than denying Harden\u2019s petitions, the trial court\n\nshould have dismissed them. See State v. Chamblin, 2023-Ohio-3129, \u00b6 9 (1st Dist.).\n\n                                        III. Conclusion\n\n        {\u00b625} We overrule the assignments of error, modify the trial court\u2019s judgments\n\nto reflect the dismissal of Harden\u2019s petitions, and affirm the judgments as modified.\n\n                                                              Judgments affirmed as modified.\n\n\n2 Smith\u2019s postconviction petition was ultimately denied after an evidentiary hearing on remand. See\n\nState v. Smith, 2019-Ohio-3642, \u00b6 16 (1st Dist.). Smith continued to attack his conviction and, in\n2017, moved to withdraw his plea under Crim.R. 32.1 based on an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim similar to Harden\u2019s claim in this case. Id. at \u00b6 25. A postsentence motion to withdraw a plea\nunder Crim.R. 32.1 must demonstrate that withdrawing the plea is \u201cnecessary \u2018to correct manifest\ninjustice.\u2019\u201d Id. at \u00b6 32, quoting Crim.R. 32.1. We held that the trial court abused its discretion by\ndenying Smith an evidentiary hearing based, in part, on an affidavit from Lawson in support of\nSmith\u2019s claims. Id. at \u00b6 38-40. We also held that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider Smith\u2019s\nmotion to withdraw his plea, which was filed more than ten years after he was convicted, because\nhis plea relied on evidence outside of the record. Id. at \u00b6 32. Motions under Crim.R. 32.1 \u201cto\nwithdraw guilty or no contest pleas and postconviction relief petitions exist independently.\u201d State\nv. Bush, 2002-Ohio-3993, \u00b6 14. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that R.C. 2953.23 is\ninapplicable to Crim.R. 32.1, which does not include a time limitation. Id.\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nNESTOR, J., concurs.\nKINSLEY, P.J., concurs separately.\n\nKINSLEY, P.J., concurring separately.\n\n        {\u00b626} With regret, I concur in the conclusion that Harden\u2019s postconviction\n\npetitions are untimely and must be dismissed, as the law enacted by the Ohio\n\nLegislature compels that result. I write separately, however, because I believe that\n\nHarden deserves a different outcome, one that is unfortunately beyond the power of\n\nthis court to create.\n\n        {\u00b627} If it were up to me, I would expunge Harden\u2019s child-endangerment\n\nconviction. But that is not my decision to make. It is exclusively the purview of the\n\nlegislative branch to determine eligibility for expungement, and the legislature has\n\ndeemed Harden\u2019s conviction ineligible for this remedy. See State v. Reed, 2005-Ohio-\n\n6251, \u00b6 16-17 (discussing former version of R.C. 2953.36(D), which barred\n\nexpungement of a felony offense involving a child under the age of 18); R.C.\n\n2953.32(A)(1)(d) (prohibiting expungement for convictions in which the victim of the\n\noffense was less than 13 years old); R.C. 2953.32(A)(1)(b) (prohibiting expungement\n\nfor convictions of a felony offense of violence).3 In recent years, however, the\n\nlegislature has amended its expungement statutes to include additional types of\n\nfelonies and to create new remedies for those seeking authorization to work despite\n\ntheir criminal histories. See State v. J.B., 2024-Ohio-1879, \u00b6 15 (1st Dist.). Harden\n\npresents a compelling case for why the legislature should consider expanding\n\neligibility for expungement to people like him.\n\n\n\n\n3 Convictions under R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) are felony offenses of violence. See State v. Q.M.E., 2022-\n\nOhio-1745, \u00b6 7, citing R.C. 2901.01(A)(9)(a).\n\n\n                                                10\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b628} As reflected in the record before us, the offense Harden seeks to expunge\n\narose within the context of his nuclear family. Now, more than two decades on,\n\nHarden\u2019s family has apparently reached a place of healing. His family fully supports\n\nhim. He successfully completed community control in 2009. Nothing in the record\n\nsuggests that Harden presents any current danger to the public, his family, or himself.\n\nTo the contrary, the record tells the story of a dedicated husband, father, and advocate\n\nfor justice who deserves to outlive the stigma of his past. But expunging his conviction\n\nwould not just benefit Harden. It would also help his family overcome the pain of his\n\nprosecution. If the legislature again amends its expungement statutes, it might\n\nconsider including individuals like Harden in its reforms.\n\n       {\u00b629} The legislative branch is not the only agency with the power to alter\n\nHarden\u2019s future. The prosecutor\u2019s office also has the power to agree that Harden can\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea to correct a manifest injustice. See Crim.R. 32.1 (governing\n\nmotions to withdraw guilty pleas). After all, at first blush, Harden presents a\n\npersuasive argument that he was misled by his attorney, who at the time was suffering\n\nfrom a serious substance-use disorder, into thinking he could expunge the offense to\n\nwhich he pled guilty. Only after serving his sentence did Harden learn this was not the\n\ncase. And Harden represents that he would not have pled guilty had he known that he\n\nwas agreeing to a lifetime criminal record.\n\n       {\u00b630} Given the unique circumstances of his situation, I agree with Harden\n\nthat the law disserved him in this case. But the court must enforce the law as it is\n\nwritten. Absent further action from the legislature or prosecutor, Harden\u2019s post-\n\nconviction petitions are time-barred and must be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">[Cite as State v.

In five assignments of error, Harden maintains\n\nthat the trial court should have granted his petitions or held an evidentiary hearing on\n\nhis claims that his trial attorney\u2019s misrepresentation of his ability to expunge his\n\nconviction induced Harden to plead guilty.\n\n        {\u00b62}     We lack authority to reach the merits of Harden\u2019s claims because the\n\ntrial court lacked jurisdiction to consider Harden\u2019s untimely petitions. Harden was\n\nconvicted by guilty plea and cannot satisfy R.C. 2953.23(A)(2)\u2019s jurisdictional\n\nrequirement of demonstrating that, \u201cbut for the constitutional error at trial, no\n\nreasonable factfinder\u201d would have convicted Harden.\n\n        {\u00b63}     Therefore, we modify the trial court\u2019s judgments to dismissals and\n\naffirm the trial court\u2019s judgments as modified.\n\n                          I. Factual and Procedural History\n\nA. Harden\u2019s attorney\u2019s misconduct\n\n        {\u00b64}     In 2004, Harden hired attorney Kenneth Lawson to defend him against\n\nfelonious-assault and child-endangerment charges. According to Harden, he relied on\n\nLawson\u2019s legal advice in which Lawson represented to Harden that his conviction\n\nwould be eligible for expungement. Harden then pleaded guilty to one count of child\n\nendangerment, a second-degree felony. The trial court accepted Harden\u2019s plea and\n\nsentenced him to the agreed five-year term of community control. Harden did not file\n\na direct appeal. In 2009, Harden was discharged from community control.\n\n        {\u00b65}     Meanwhile, Lawson received an interim suspension from practicing law\n\nin 2007 due to allegations of \u201cnumerous violations of the Code of Professional\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nResponsibility and [the] substantial threat of serious harm [that he poses] to his clients\n\nand the public.\u201d Disciplinary Counsel v. Lawson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">113 Ohio St.3d 1508</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1508 (2007).\n\nThe claims against Lawson ranged from misappropriating his clients\u2019 funds to\n\nneglecting, or abandoning, his clients\u2019 cases. See Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Lawson,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2008-Ohio-3340</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 66.\n\n       {\u00b66}   During the disciplinary proceedings, Lawson \u201cadmitted himself to a\n\nrehabilitation facility after more than seven years of drug abuse.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 5. Indeed,\n\nLawson\u2019s substance use had \u201cseverely compromised the interests of his clients, the\n\nlegal system, the legal profession, and the public.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 74. So, in 2008, the Supreme\n\nCourt of Ohio indefinitely suspended Lawson from practicing law. See id.\n\n       {\u00b67}   Later that year, Lawson pleaded guilty to federal charges of \u201cconspiracy\n\nto obtain Schedule II controlled substances by deception . . . between August 2003 and\n\n2007.\u201d Disciplinary Counsel v. Lawson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2691041\"><a href=\"/opinion/2691041/disciplinary-counsel-v-lawson/#9\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Disciplinary Counsel v.

Id. at \u00b6 4-9. To avoid detection, Lawson instructed the physician to use\n\nLawson\u2019s clients\u2019 names for those prescriptions. Id. at \u00b6 7. After a second disciplinary\n\ncomplaint, in 2011 the Supreme Court of Ohio permanently disbarred Lawson from\n\npracticing law due to the extent of Lawson\u2019s conspiracy. Id. at \u00b6 36.\n\nB. Harden\u2019s postconviction petitions\n\n       {\u00b68}   In September 2024, Harden petitioned for postconviction relief under\n\nR.C. 2953.21, claiming that Lawson had provided constitutionally ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel by inducing Harden to plead guilty, not investigating Harden\u2019s\n\ncase, and misrepresenting to Harden that he could have his child-endangerment\n\nconviction expunged. In his petition, Harden pointed out that Lawson had admitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nduring a disciplinary hearing, to being under the influence of drugs when he\n\nencouraged his clients to accept plea offers from the State in 2004.\n\n       {\u00b69}     Harden explained that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering\n\nLawson\u2019s misconduct because it \u201cwas revealed 4 years after [Harden\u2019s] sentencing, by\n\ncounsel himself in his disciplinary hearing\u201d and Harden was advised in 2009 \u201cto wait\n\nthree years from being discharged\u201d to request expungement of his conviction. In\n\nsupport of his petition, Harden attached his criminal case docket, Lawson\u2019s\n\nsuspension and disbarment orders, and a letter from Harden\u2019s son on behalf of Harden\n\nproclaiming Harden\u2019s innocence in the child-endangerment matter. Weeks later,\n\nHarden moved for summary judgment on his petition.\n\n       {\u00b610} Then in January 2025, Harden filed an amended petition for\n\npostconviction relief to emphasize Lawson\u2019s efforts to convince Harden to plead guilty.\n\nIn support, he attached a notarized statement from his wife, the mother of the victim\n\nin   Harden\u2019s    child-endangerment    case.   Harden\u2019s   wife   described   Lawson\u2019s\n\nmisrepresentations about the consequences of a conviction for child endangerment,\n\nwhich heavily influenced Harden\u2019s decision to plead guilty.\n\n       {\u00b611} In February 2025, the trial court found Harden\u2019s petitions \u201cnot well\n\ntaken\u201d and denied the petitions.\n\n                                    II. Analysis\n\n       {\u00b612}    On appeal, Harden challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his\n\npostconviction petitions in five assignments of error. First, Harden argues that the\n\ntrial court should have found that Lawson\u2019s constitutionally-deficient legal assistance\n\ndeprived Harden of his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution. Second, he asserts that the trial court should have held an evidentiary\n\nhearing. Third, he maintains that Lawson\u2019s extreme and pervasive misconduct\n\n\n                                          5\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\namounted to a complete denial of counsel under United States v.

I write separately, however, because I believe that\n\nHarden deserves a different outcome, one that is unfortunately beyond the power of\n\nthis court to create.\n\n        {\u00b627} If it were up to me, I would expunge Harden\u2019s child-endangerment\n\nconviction. But that is not my decision to make. It is exclusively the purview of the\n\nlegislative branch to determine eligibility for expungement, and the legislature has\n\ndeemed Harden\u2019s conviction ineligible for this remedy. See State v. Reed, 2005-Ohio-\n\n6251, \u00b6 16-17 (discussing former version of R.C. 2953.36(D), which barred\n\nexpungement of a felony offense involving a child under the age of 18); R.C.\n\n2953.32(A)(1)(d) (prohibiting expungement for convictions in which the victim of the\n\noffense was less than 13 years old); R.C. 2953.32(A)(1)(b) (prohibiting expungement\n\nfor convictions of a felony offense of violence).3 In recent years, however, the\n\nlegislature has amended its expungement statutes to include additional types of\n\nfelonies and to create new remedies for those seeking authorization to work despite\n\ntheir criminal histories. See State v. J.B., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9969639\"><a href=\"/opinion/9503026/state-v-jb/#15\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State v.

Harden\n\npresents a compelling case for why the legislature should consider expanding\n\neligibility for expungement to people like him.\n\n\n\n\n3 Convictions under R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) are felony offenses of violence. See State v. Q.M.E., 2022-\n\nOhio-1745, \u00b6 7, citing R.C. 2901.01(A)(9)(a).\n\n\n                                                10\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b628} As reflected in the record before us, the offense Harden seeks to expunge\n\narose within the context of his nuclear family. Now, more than two decades on,\n\nHarden\u2019s family has apparently reached a place of healing. His family fully supports\n\nhim. He successfully completed community control in 2009. Nothing in the record\n\nsuggests that Harden presents any current danger to the public, his family, or himself.\n\nTo the contrary, the record tells the story of a dedicated husband, father, and advocate\n\nfor justice who deserves to outlive the stigma of his past. But expunging his conviction\n\nwould not just benefit Harden. It would also help his family overcome the pain of his\n\nprosecution. If the legislature again amends its expungement statutes, it might\n\nconsider including individuals like Harden in its reforms.\n\n       {\u00b629} The legislative branch is not the only agency with the power to alter\n\nHarden\u2019s future. The prosecutor\u2019s office also has the power to agree that Harden can\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea to correct a manifest injustice. See Crim.R. 32.1 (governing\n\nmotions to withdraw guilty pleas). After all, at first blush, Harden presents a\n\npersuasive argument that he was misled by his attorney, who at the time was suffering\n\nfrom a serious substance-use disorder, into thinking he could expunge the offense to\n\nwhich he pled guilty. Only after serving his sentence did Harden learn this was not the\n\ncase. And Harden represents that he would not have pled guilty had he known that he\n\nwas agreeing to a lifetime criminal record.\n\n       {\u00b630} Given the unique circumstances of his situation, I agree with Harden\n\nthat the law disserved him in this case. But the court must enforce the law as it is\n\nwritten. Absent further action from the legislature or prosecutor, Harden\u2019s post-\n\nconviction petitions are time-barred and must be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f</pre>", "extracted_by_ocr": false, "ordering_key": null, "main_version": null, "opinions_cited": ["https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/111169/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/2691041/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/2705885/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/3176835/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/3725406/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/3730131/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/3739293/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/3740705/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/3761030/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/4093762/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/4345574/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/4437092/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/8482836/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/9430227/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/9882404/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/9907290/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/9969639/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/11147715/", "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/11152828/"]}, {"resource_uri": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/11206864/", "id": 11206864, "absolute_url": "/opinion/10740279/state-v-smothers/", "cluster_id": 10740279, "cluster": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/clusters/10740279/", "author_id": 8118, "author": "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/people/8118/", "joined_by": [], "date_created": "2025-11-21T07:18:39.754965-08:00", "date_modified": "2025-11-21T07:18:48.573000-08:00", "author_str": "", "per_curiam": false, "joined_by_str": "", "type": "010combined", "sha1": "c077bf0908dd7f4cf3beff172fec677fe1fcc8eb", "page_count": 40, "download_url": "https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/1/2025/2025-Ohio-5250.pdf", "local_path": "pdf/2025/11/21/state_v._smothers.pdf", "plain_text": "[Cite as State v.

Smothers, 2025-Ohio-5250.]\n\n\nMOORE, Judge.\n\n        {\u00b61}     On the morning of January 1, 2018, police were called to a mobile-home\n\npark in Sharonville, Ohio. They were responding to a report that the nude body of a\n\nwoman was lying behind a dumpster near one of the trailers.1 While police were\n\nconducting their investigation, defendant-appellant Brian Smothers came out of his\n\ntrailer. Smothers explained to the officers that he needed to leave for work and asked\n\nif the police and emergency vehicles blocking his car could be moved. Smothers\u2019\n\nrequest was accommodated, the vehicles were moved, and he drove off\u2014but not to\n\nwork. Instead, Smothers drove to his father\u2019s home in Grant County, Kentucky.\n\n        {\u00b62}     After Smothers drove off, the investigating officers learned that the dead\n\nwoman was Smothers\u2019 wife, L.S. A police broadcast was made to be on the lookout for\n\nSmothers and the dark blue Hyundai Santa Fe he was driving, and warrants were\n\nissued for his arrest and for the search of his car. When the police broadcast reached\n\nthe Grant County Sheriff\u2019s Office, they sent an officer to the house of Smothers\u2019 father,\n\nwhere Smothers was found and arrested. Smothers\u2019 car was parked in the driveway of\n\nhis father\u2019s house. The Grant County Sheriff seized the vehicle and held it until it was\n\ntransported to the Sharonville Police Department where it was searched.\n\n        {\u00b63}     In this appeal, Smothers challenges his convictions for murder, gross\n\nabuse of a corpse, and tampering with evidence in seven assignments of error, alleging\n\n(1) the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress, (2) he was prejudiced by\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, (3) the admission of L.S.\u2019s autopsy photos unfairly inflamed\n\nthe passions of the jury, (4) his convictions were based on insufficient evidence, (5)\n\nthe State committed a Brady violation by destroying an untested sexual-assault kit,\n\n\n\n1 According to the affidavit to the arrest warrant, a neighbor and her nine-year-old daughter saw\n\nthe body lying behind the dumpster which prompted the call to police.\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n(6) the trial court erred by denying Smothers\u2019 proposed jury instruction regarding the\n\nalleged Brady violation, and (7) the trial court erred by overruling his motion for a\n\nnew trial based on juror misconduct.\n\n       {\u00b64}   For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n                       I. Factual and Procedural History\n\n       {\u00b65}   Smothers was indicted for two counts of murder, special felonies, in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2903.02(A) and (B), one count of felonious assault, a second-degree\n\nfelony, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), one count of gross abuse of a corpse, a fifth-\n\ndegree felony, in violation of R.C. 2927.01(B), and two counts of tampering with\n\nevidence, third-degree felonies, in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1).\n\n              A. The Hearing on Smothers\u2019 Motion to Suppress\n\n       {\u00b66}   Smothers filed a motion to suppress citing Collins v. Virginia, 584 U.S.\n\n586 (2018), and arguing that the automobile exception to the warrant requirement\n\ndoes not permit an officer to enter a home or its curtilage to search a vehicle. Id. at\n\n600. Smothers asserted that the affidavit in support of the warrant was defective\n\nbecause his car was not located in the jurisdiction of the issuing judge when the\n\nwarrant was issued on January 1, 2018. Instead, his car was at his father\u2019s home in\n\nGrant County, Kentucky. Smothers argued that the Sharonville police conducted a\n\nwarrantless search of his car because it did not arrive at the police department until\n\nJanuary 2, 2018.\n\n                      Detective Brad Hondorf\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b67}   Sharonville Police Detective Brad Hondorf assisted with the\n\ninvestigation of L.S.\u2019s death. Hondorf testified that during the initial investigation,\n\nSmothers came out of his trailer as the paramedics were leaving and asked the officers\n\nto move their cars. After they did, he left the scene. Hondorf explained that at that\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\npoint, L.S.\u2019s identity was unknown. Hondorf explained that after the police cars and\n\nemergency vehicles were moved, the officers saw \u201cdrag marks\u201d in the snow leading\n\nfrom where L.S.\u2019s body was found to Lot 15\u2014Smothers\u2019 trailer.\n\n       {\u00b68}   After searching their database, the officers learned that police had\n\nrecently responded to a report of domestic violence at the Smotherses home. Hondorf\n\nalso testified that based on previous photos, they were able to identify L.S. by her\n\n\u201cdistinct tattoos.\u201d They used a photo of Smothers to confirm his identity with the\n\nofficer whom Smothers spoke to prior to driving away. Smothers\u2019 neighbors also\n\nreported to the officers that they saw Smothers leaving in his car.\n\n       {\u00b69}   Hondorf explained that Smothers was permitted to leave because\n\nneither he nor the body of L.S. had been identified at that point. Hondorf testified that\n\nSmothers became a suspect after he had left and the officers saw the drag marks and\n\nidentified the body. He further explained that the investigators became interested in\n\nthe car after they reviewed the video from a neighbor\u2019s surveillance camera. That\n\nfootage showed a \u201csubject throughout the night going back and forth\u201d \u201cdragging\n\nsomething the size of a body,\u201d and the pathway indicated that the subject made several\n\ntrips from the dumpster to the area where Lot 15 was, including carrying what looked\n\nlike a garbage bag towards the dumpster.\n\n       {\u00b610} A warrant was issued for Smothers\u2019 arrest for abuse of a corpse. Hondorf\n\ntestified that the Grant County Sheriff\u2019s Department was notified that Smothers\u2019 father\n\nlived in that county, and on January 1, 2018, a Grant County deputy sheriff went to the\n\nhome of Smother\u2019s father where Smothers and his car were found. Hondorf explained\n\nthat Sharonville police believed that L.S.\u2019s missing clothes, blood, or other evidence\n\ncould be in Smothers\u2019 car. After Smothers was arrested, his car was impounded at the\n\nGrant County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n                                           5\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b611} During his testimony, Hondorf conceded that Smothers\u2019 car was not in\n\nHamilton County when he submitted the affidavit for a search warrant for the car on\n\nJanuary 1, 2018. He also conceded that the car did not arrive at the Sharonville Police\n\nDepartment until January 2, 2018. t. Hondorf testified, however, that the police had\n\nno intention of executing the search warrant on Smothers\u2019 car until it was in Hamilton\n\nCounty.\n\n       {\u00b612} Hondorf testified that the warrant to search Smothers\u2019 car was obtained\n\nbecause, once the car was found, it would be seized and transported to the Sharonville\n\nPolice Department to be searched for evidence. He explained that probable cause to\n\nsearch the car arose when Smothers, later identified as a suspect, had left the scene in\n\nhis car.\n\n                       Detective Scott Conrad\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b613} Detective Scott Conrad, with the Grant County Sheriff\u2019s Office, testified\n\nthat their dispatch received a call from Sharonville police asking for assistance in\n\nlocating Smothers and his car. Conrad conceded that the car was parked on private\n\nproperty when the Grant County sheriffs seized it, and they did not have a search\n\nwarrant issued by a judge in Kentucky. Conrad, however, explained that, at that point,\n\nSmothers had been charged in Grant County as a fugitive from another state, and there\n\nwas a National Crime Information Center (\u201cNCIC\u201d) warrant for his arrest.\n\n       {\u00b614} Conrad testified that the Grant County deputy sheriffs went to the\n\naddress given by Sharonville police and saw Smothers walking to the front door and\n\nhis car parked in the driveway. Conrad explained that the vehicle was not searched in\n\nGrant County and that the sheriff\u2019s office taped the doors of the car shut to ensure that\n\nit was not searched until it was in Sharonville.\n\n           The Trial Court Denies Smothers\u2019 Motion to Suppress\n\n\n                                           6\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n         {\u00b615} The trial court, referring to the \u201cOhio Arrest Search and Seizure\u201d\n\nmanual, stated that there are not \u201cany rules [under the automobile exception] that\n\nbear a magic line, at the border of Ohio, and they can\u2019t go into another jurisdiction,\n\nlike Kentucky.\u201d The court stated that \u201cthe whole idea about the auto[mobile] exception\n\nwas to give officers an opportunity to follow a very inherent mobility of a vehicle,\u201d\n\nwhich \u201ccreates circumstances of such exigency that it is practically a necessity.\u201d The\n\ncourt added that individuals have a reduced expectation of privacy where a warrantless\n\nsearch is based on probable cause. The court stated that there was probable cause to\n\nsearch Smothers\u2019 car because L.S.\u2019s body was found behind the dumpster, tracks led\n\nback to the Smotherses trailer, the video showed someone dragging something to the\n\ndumpster, and Smothers, the main suspect, left the scene in his car. The court further\n\nstated that no warrant was needed to seize the vehicle and hold it pending the search\n\nas the \u201cSupreme Court has said that a car that has been seized and brought to police\n\nheadquarters and even sits as long as two weeks, there was no need for a search\n\nwarrant.\u201d The trial court denied the motion to suppress, and the case proceeded to\n\ntrial.\n\n                                     B. The Trial\n\n                                  K.C.\u2019s Testimony\n\n         {\u00b616} K.C. testified that she knew Smothers and L.S. She testified that around\n\n9:30 a.m. on January 1, 2018, she looked outside of her window and saw a body lying\n\nby the dumpster. She stated that she went to see if the person was okay but saw red\n\nspots in the snow, that the woman was naked, and there was blood going down her\n\nchest and nose. Realizing that the woman was dead, she called 9-1-1.\n\n\n\n                           Greg Shewbridge\u2019s Testimony\n\n\n                                           7\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b617} Greg Shewbridge, an EMT with the Sharonville Fire Department,\n\ntestified that once the emergency vehicles and police cars were moved to allow\n\nSmothers to leave, an officer showed Shewbridge that there were drag marks coming\n\nfrom Trailer 15, which was the trailer that Smothers came out of and lived in.\n\nShewbridge stated that this caused him concern that \u201cthe suspect of a crime had just\n\nfled the scene.\u201d\n\n                      Officer David Landsberg\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b618} Officer Landsberg, a Cincinnati police criminalist, was called to the\n\nscene by Sharonville officers. He testified about what he observed at the scene and\n\nidentified the photographs taken at the scene as they were introduced into evidence.\n\nOfficer Landsberg described the drag marks and blood found along the trail from\n\nTrailer 15 to the dumpster and described the shoe prints found in the snow along the\n\ntrail and at the base of the steps of Trailer 15. Officer Landsberg testified that the police\n\nand medical responders were careful not to disturb the shoe imprints. Officer\n\nLandsberg also explained that there were no signs of forced entry into the trailer.\n\n       {\u00b619} Officer Landsberg also participated in the search of Smothers\u2019 car\u2014\n\nwhich had crime tape around it before the search began\u2014at the Sharonville police\n\nstation. Officer Landsberg testified that L.S.\u2019s cell phone was found on the front\n\npassenger seat, and \u201creddish stains\u201d were found on and above the dials used to adjust\n\nthe driver\u2019s seat. A navy-blue sweatshirt with different stains was found in the back of\n\nthe car along with green towels with reddish stains that were found in the trunk.\n\nOfficer Landsberg testified that the shoe print that he obtained from the floor mat of\n\nthe driver\u2019s side matched the shoe prints found on the trail of drag marks at the scene.\n\n\n\n                           Officer Lee Jacobs\u2019 Testimony\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b620} Officer Lee Jacobs testified that L.S.\u2019s purse was found in the front room\n\nof Smothers\u2019 trailer and that Smothers\u2019 blood was found on the purse strap. Officer\n\nJacobs described seeing a \u201cperson walking back and forth\u201d and what appeared to be a\n\n\u201cbody or something very large\u201d near the dumpster on the surveillance video from a\n\nneighboring trailer, which prompted the officers to search the dumpster. Jacobs\n\ntestified that the contents in the garbage bag recovered from the dumpster included\n\njeans that had a \u201cseeping brown stain,\u201d a soiled pair of women\u2019s underwear that had\n\nbeen torn or cut, and mail belonging to Smothers. He also testified that soiled towels\n\nand L.S.\u2019s cell phone were found in Smothers\u2019 car.\n\n                           Michael Trimpe\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b621} Michael Trimpe, a trace evidence examiner with the Hamilton County\n\nCoroner\u2019s crime laboratory, testified that he determined that the boot prints found at\n\nthe scene matched the boots that Smothers was wearing when he was arrested.\n\n                                 E.M.\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b622} E.M. was the neighbor whose surveillance camera captured the person\n\ndragging what was discovered to be L.S.\u2019s body to the dumpster and walking back and\n\nforth. E.M. testified that in reviewing his surveillance footage, he noticed that his\n\nmaroon truck looked gray due to the infrared lights on the camera.\n\n                         Dr. Karen Looman\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b623} Dr. Karen Looman was a deputy coroner with the Hamilton County\n\nCoroner\u2019s Office when she conducted L.S.\u2019s autopsy. Dr. Looman testified that, while\n\nthe coroner\u2019s office typically conducts an autopsy within 24 hours of receiving a\n\ndecedent\u2019s body, L.S.\u2019s autopsy could not be performed for two days because her body\n\nwas completely frozen after being left outside in the cold.\n\n                              The Autopsy Photographs\n\n\n                                           9\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b624} Dr. Looman testified to the condition of L.S.\u2019s body and identified\n\nphotographs and diagrams of the autopsy, which were introduced into evidence. The\n\nphotographs showed that L.S.\u2019s body was nude when it arrived at the coroner\u2019s office,\n\nhad to be thawed, and reflected injuries that had occurred both before and after death.\n\n       {\u00b625} Defense counsel objected to the photographs at sidebar, arguing that\n\nthey were cumulative and the probative value was not outweighed by prejudice. The\n\ntrial court overruled the objection, stating that the State was putting on evidence\n\nregarding the count for gross abuse of a corpse, and there had been \u201cvery few\n\nphotographs that would be duplicative.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b626} Dr. Looman continued to testify to the injuries found on L.S.\u2019s legs,\n\nheels, and various areas of her face and head. Dr. Looman noted there was dirt on each\n\nheel which was consistent with the body being dragged. Dr. Looman testified that, due\n\nto the injuries on L.S.\u2019s face and hemorrhaging in her eyes, she conducted a forensic\n\nneck dissection to determine whether L.S. had been strangled. Photographs depicting\n\nhemorrhaging of the muscle of L.S.\u2019s throat, thyroid cartilage, and hyoid2 along with\n\ndiagrams of the human throat were introduced as Dr. Looman explained the process\n\nof the forensic neck dissection. The photograph of L.S.\u2019s throat showed trauma and\n\nthat the thyroid cartilage was broken. Autopsy photographs showing the examination\n\nof L.S.\u2019s head and exposure of her skull were introduced to help Dr. Looman explain\n\nthe blunt force trauma that L.S.\u2019s head sustained prior to her death.\n\n       {\u00b627} Dr. Looman testified that the injuries that L.S. sustained showed that\n\nshe died due to asphyxia by strangulation. She explained that a strangling victim tends\n\n\n\n\n2   The hyoid bone is a crescent-shaped bone               at the front of the neck.\nSeehttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hyoid-bone    (accessed Oct. 20, 2025)\n[https://perma.cc/Y58D-8L86].\n\n\n                                            10\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nto struggle with their assailant, including scratching them. Dr. Looman testified there\n\nwere signs that L.S. attempted to fight off her assailant, and that her fingernails were\n\ncut to test for DNA. As discussed in more detail below, Dr. Looman also testified that\n\nshe performed a sexual-assault examination, swabbing different parts of L.S.\u2019s body\n\nand placing those swabs in a \u201csexual-assault kit\u201d before washing the body off.\n\n       {\u00b628} Dr. Looman testified that the coroner\u2019s lab was relocated from Eden\n\nAvenue in Avondale to the city of Blue Ash. Dr. Looman further explained that in\n\npreparation for that move, the untested sexual-assault kit was destroyed. Dr. Looman\n\nadded that she typically would not have the kit destroyed with a homicide case, and no\n\nother evidence in this case was destroyed.\n\n                           Jennifer Dillon\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b629} Jennifer Dillon, a Cincinnati police criminalist, testified to conducting a\n\ncell-phone analysis on Smothers\u2019 and L.S.\u2019s cell phones. She testified that the phone\n\nrecords that she reviewed showed that neither phone was moved from the vicinity of\n\nthe Smotherses trailer overnight, prior to L.S.\u2019s body being discovered.\n\n                        Tracy Sundermeier\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b630} Tracy Sundermeier, a forensic biologist with the Hamilton County crime\n\nlaboratory, recalled conducting DNA testing on swabs from blood found along the drag\n\nmarks in the snow, a purse strap, a black T-shirt, a pair of boots, blue jeans, a black\n\nhooded sweatshirt, towels, swabs labeled to have been taken from Smothers, fingernail\n\nclippings from L.S., and bodily fluids from L.S. and Smothers. She explained that the\n\nblood found in the drag marks and on Smothers\u2019 jeans and boots belonged to L.S., and\n\nthe blood on the black T-shirt belonged to Smothers.\n\n              C. The Hearing on Smothers\u2019 Motion to Dismiss\n\n       {\u00b631} Smothers moved to dismiss the charges against him or, in the\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nalternative, sanction the State\u2019s failure to preserve the untested sexual-assault kit.3 He\n\nargued that R.C. 2933.82 required the State to preserve the swabs for 30 years\n\nfollowing a conviction or as long as the \u201cact\u201d remains unresolved, and, the destruction\n\nof the untested kit warranted dismissal of his charges or \u201cother appropriate sanctions.\u201d\n\n                                Dr. Looman\u2019s Testimony\n\n        {\u00b632} Dr. Looman testified that she conducted the sexual-assault examination\n\nbefore L.S.\u2019s body left the coroner\u2019s office \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d that L.S.\n\ncould have been a victim of sexual homicide as her body was found nude. Dr. Looman\n\nagain testified that the autopsy revealed no signs of sexual assault\u2014particularly, no\n\ninjuries to L.S.\u2019s genitals. She testified that results from the swabs would not have\n\ndetermined whether any sexual contact was consensual. Dr. Looman further testified\n\nthat only L.S.\u2019s and Smothers\u2019 DNA were found on L.S.\u2019s body.\n\n        {\u00b633} Dr. Looman explained that swabs from the kit are stored and would\n\nhave been tested at the request of the police department or the State, but since there\n\nwas no request, the swabs were never tested. Dr. Looman further explained that the\n\ncoroner\u2019s office needed to determine what materials did not need to go to the new\n\nfacility when the office moved.\n\n        {\u00b634} Dr. Looman testified that either the \u201cevidence receiving\u201d or \u201cDNA\u201d\n\ndepartment at the coroner\u2019s office requested that the sexual-assault kit for L.S. be\n\ndestroyed. Dr. Looman explained that she reviewed Smothers\u2019 case and, as it had been\n\npending for nearly three years and she had no indication from the police reports or the\n\nState that sexual assault was alleged, the kit was destroyed in December 2020. Dr.\n\nLooman testified that the kit was the only item that she permitted to be destroyed in\n\n\n\n3 It is not readily apparent from the record whether he made an oral motion or if a clerical error\n\nresulted in the motion not being entered on the docket.\n\n\n                                               12\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nSmothers\u2019 case.\n\n       {\u00b635} While Dr. Looman stated that authorizing the destruction of the kit was\n\na mistake, she also testified that any results from the test would be purely speculative\n\neven if L.S. had engaged in sexual activity prior to her death.\n\n                         Detective Hondorf\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b636} Hondorf testified that he was present during the autopsy, the decision\n\nto conduct a sexual-assault examination was the coroner\u2019s decision, and he had not\n\nasked that the sexual-assault kit be tested for DNA. He added that no one from the\n\npolice department requested that the kit be destroyed.\n\n            The Trial Court Denies Smothers\u2019 Motion to Dismiss\n\n       {\u00b637} Defense counsel argued in closing that the sexual-assault kit was\n\ndestroyed in violation of R.C. 2933.82. Counsel asserted that the coroner failed to\n\nprovide the proper notifications, and the kit would not have been impractical to store.\n\nCounsel initially expressed uncertainty that the evidence would have been exculpatory\n\nbut later stated it would have been exculpatory evidence if it showed that L.S. had\n\nengaged in intercourse with someone other than Smothers prior to her death.\n\n       {\u00b638} The State countered that any evidence derived from testing the kit\n\nwould be purely speculative, and thus, not materially exculpatory but rather\n\npotentially useful. The State added that there was no bad faith on Dr. Looman\u2019s part;\n\nciting Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51 (1988), the State asserted that Smothers\n\nfailed to show otherwise because Dr. Looman\u2019s testimony that it was a mistake to\n\ndestroy the kit did not demonstrate bad faith, which requires dishonesty, conscious\n\nwrongdoing, or an ulterior motive.\n\n       {\u00b639} The trial court stated that it \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d agreed with the State\u2019s\n\nposition and denied Smothers\u2019 motion to dismiss.\n\n\n                                           13\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n                             D. The Trial Continues\n\n                         Detective Hondorf\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b640} Hondorf testified that L.S.\u2019s blood was found on Smothers\u2019 jeans, left\n\nboot, jacket, and the strap of the purse found in the Smotherses trailer. He further\n\ntestified that there were scratches on Smothers\u2019 face when he was arrested and\n\nSmothers\u2019 DNA was found underneath L.S.\u2019s fingernails. Hondorf recalled\n\nparticipating in the search inside the dumpster that L.S. was found lying near, and that\n\nthe garbage bag matched those found inside of the Smotherses trailer.\n\n       {\u00b641} Hondorf stated that officers had no reason to believe that a sexual\n\nassault took place. He testified that officers investigated R.P.\u2013an alleged paramour of\n\nL.S.\u2013as a potential suspect in L.S.\u2019s death but they found no evidence regarding R.P.\n\n                               Smothers\u2019 Testimony\n\n       {\u00b642} Smothers testified that L.S. scratched his face around 9:30 p.m. on New\n\nYear\u2019s Eve during a disagreement about Smothers\u2019 father having the phone numbers\n\nof the mothers of Smothers\u2019 other children. Smothers asserted that L.S. scratched his\n\nface because he laughed at her after she told his father that, unlike those women, she\n\n\u201cwasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d Smothers testified that L.S. then told him that she was going\n\nto \u201cdrink all the alcohol\u201d and have sex with someone else.\n\n       {\u00b643} Smothers testified that he had fallen asleep at 7:30 p.m., and L.S. was\n\nsitting in the back bedroom of the trailer when he woke up at 9:30 p.m. He stated that\n\nhe asked L.S. to wake him up at 11:30 p.m. and then went back to sleep.\n\n       {\u00b644} Smothers testified that L.S. was supposed to wake him at 5:45 a.m. so\n\nhe could drive her to work, and he had plans to visit his father in Williamstown,\n\nKentucky. Smothers stated that he woke up at 3:00 a.m. and the front door of the\n\ntrailer was \u201cstanding wide open and the heater had been turned off.\u201d He testified that\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nhe assumed that L.S. was in the back bedroom where the curtain was \u201cclosed all the\n\nway\u201d and that L.S. must have left the door open to \u201cfreez[e] [him] out.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b645} Smothers testified that when he did not see L.S. in the back bedroom at\n\n6:30 a.m. he figured she had gone to work. He testified that he saw her cell phone and\n\n\u201cstarted to go through\u201d it. He stated that he saw messages between L.S. and her friend,\n\nand L.S. stated that she was fed up with Smothers passing out and she was planning\n\non leaving to be with another man, so Smothers figured that was where she went.\n\n       {\u00b646} Smothers testified that the person dragging \u201csomething\u201d in the footage\n\nfrom the neighbor\u2019s home-surveillance camera was a different person than shown in\n\nthe State\u2019s four subsequent videos, but it was not him. On cross-examination,\n\nSmothers testified that the person in the video appeared to be wearing a hoody, pants,\n\nand \u201cshoes of some kind\u201d and \u201cdragging\u201d his wife but refuted that they were wearing\n\nthe same clothing as he was when he was arrested because the colors were \u201creversed.\u201d\n\nHe conceded that the footage shows a person carrying a bag in the direction of the\n\ndumpster, and the person looked directly at the camera. He agreed that the drag marks\n\nfound by police came from his trailer but contended that the marks started in the front\n\nyard and L.S. was killed in the \u201cgeneral vicinity\u201d of his trailer versus inside of it. He\n\nasserted that he was asleep at the time the activity that was caught on video occurred.\n\n       {\u00b647} Smothers testified that, by the time the police arrived, he had \u201csmoked\n\na joint\u201d and had three shots of vodka so he wanted to \u201cget away from\u201d them as he had\n\npreviously been arrested while being intoxicated around the police. He testified that\n\nOfficer Bookman was putting up crime-scene tape when he asked if he could leave\n\nbecause he needed to go to work. Smothers stated that he did not tell the police that\n\nhe really was going to visit his father because the police would be more likely to allow\n\nhim to leave if he had to go to work.\n\n\n                                           15\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b648} Smothers testified that he was halfway to his father\u2019s house when he\n\nrealized L.S.\u2019s phone was in his pocket, which was a \u201cforce of habit\u201d because he had\n\ndisconnected his cell phone and only used her phone. He stated that he planned to\n\nreturn to Sharonville to pick L.S. up from work around 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\n\n       {\u00b649} Smothers testified that he was sitting on his father\u2019s couch when the\n\nGrant County sheriffs called him out of the house and arrested him. He stated that he\n\ndid not know why he was being arrested until he got to the sheriff\u2019s office, and a deputy\n\ntold him there was a felony warrant from \u201canother state\u201d for abuse of a corpse. He\n\ntestified that he discovered that he was arrested for killing L.S. after he was placed in\n\na holding cell. Smothers repeatedly denied killing L.S. during his testimony.\n\n                         The State Refers to Smothers as a Liar\n\n       {\u00b650} While cross-examining Smothers about his infidelity in his marriage\n\nwith L.S., the prosecutor stated that Smothers \u201cquite frankly just cheated in almost\n\nevery relationship that [he] ever had.\u201d The prosecutor asked, \u201cYou have lied over and\n\nover and over to the most important people in your life; is that correct?\u201d and \u201cYou lied\n\nto [the police], hey, I\u2019m going to work?\u201d The prosecutor also stated that Smothers had\n\nlied in his \u201cmost important relationships\u201d to cheat, and, referring to the trial, that he\n\ncould not \u201cthink of a better time to lie . . . .\u201d Smothers did not object to either statement.\n\n     Counsel Asserts that the State Violated Smothers\u2019 Fifth Amendment Rights\n\n       {\u00b651} The following exchange also took place during cross-examination:\n\n       Q. Yesterday, sir, was the first time that anyone heard any of this\n\n       information that you gave us; isn\u2019t that correct?\n\n       A. Other than my lawyers, yes.\n\n       Q. Right. Why didn\u2019t you tell anybody about this stranger that killed\n\n       your wife sir?\n\n\n                                             16\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       A. Because I didn\u2019t know anything about the stranger that killed my wife\n\n       until I got the discovery. I didn\u2019t even know my wife was dead until I got\n\n       arrested.\n\n       Q When you found out she was dead, why didn\u2019t you share any of this\n\n       information?\n\n       A. Because I\u2019m constitutionally protected to only have to speak to my\n\n       attorney.\n\n       Q. Don\u2019t you want to find your wife\u2019s killer, sir?\n\n       A. Absolutely.\n\n       Q. Don\u2019t you think law enforcement\u2019s job is to find [L.S.\u2019] killer, sir?\n\n       A. I do believe it is.\n\n       Q. You want to help, correct?\n\n       A. I would help them if they came to me. Never once did law\n\n       enforcement try and re-interview me.\n\n       Q. They are not allowed to contact you.\n\n       {\u00b652} At sidebar, defense counsel asserted that being asked why he did not tell\n\nlaw enforcement a stranger killed his wife violated Smothers\u2019 right to remain silent\n\nand moved for a mistrial. In response to the State\u2019s argument that Smothers waived\n\nhis right to remain silent by taking the stand, defense counsel argued that Smothers\u2019\n\nright to remain silent upon his arrest is distinguishable from waiving this right by\n\ntestifying in his own defense. The trial court, while cautioning the State in its line of\n\nquestioning, concluded that, by bringing up the new theory that a stranger killed L.S.,\n\nthe State had the right to ask why Smothers did not share this information before.\n\n                          The Jury Finds Smothers Guilty\n\n       {\u00b653} The jury found Smothers guilty on all six counts. The trial court merged\n\n\n                                           17\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nthe second count of murder and the felonious-assault count with the first count of\n\nmurder for sentencing purposes. Smothers was ordered to serve the sentence for\n\nmurder consecutively to the sentence for gross abuse of a corpse and serve the\n\nsentences for both counts of tampering with evidence concurrently with the sentences\n\nin the other counts, for an aggregate sentence of 16-years-to-life imprisonment with a\n\njail-time credit of 1,675 days.\n\n                      E. Smothers\u2019 Motion for a New Trial\n\n       {\u00b654} During the polling of the jury, juror T.L. made a statement to the effect\n\nthat she could see how the infrared feature on her own home-surveillance footage\n\naffects the colors of objects. Smothers filed a motion for a new trial, alleging that T.L.\n\nconducted an experiment that affected the outcome of the trial.\n\n       {\u00b655} The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on Smothers\u2019 motion for a\n\nnew trial based on juror misconduct.\n\n       {\u00b656} During the hearing, T.L. testified that, after deliberations, she had\n\ndiscussed with some jurors that she was looking at camera footage on her cellular\n\nphone from her Ring camera recordings and noticed the colors were different \u201con\n\ninfrared,\u201d which she believed turns on at night. She stated it was not an experiment,\n\nand that she looked at footage from the Ring camera from her phone all the time. T.L.\n\nexplained that she mentioned what she saw on her camera footage while the jurors\n\nwere talking to the attorneys, not while watching the video evidence or during\n\ndeliberations. She denied looking at the cameras just to see if \u201cthey reversed colors.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b657} On cross-examination, T.L. clarified that the jury was waiting to be\n\ncalled back into the courtroom to deliver the verdicts when she mentioned that she\n\nhad noticed that the colors were different in the footage of her cameras. T.L. testified\n\nthat the colors of the camera did not impact her conclusions of Smothers\u2019 guilt, and\n\n\n                                           18\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nthe evidence she considered was Smothers\u2019 possession of L.S.\u2019s cell phone, Smothers\u2019\n\nversion of his wife\u2019s whereabouts, and the evidence found in the garbage bag with\n\nL.S.\u2019s soiled undergarments. She added that she was tasked with going through the\n\nevidence which would point to Smothers\u2019 innocence, but the other evidence showed\n\nthat he was guilty of murder.\n\n       {\u00b658} The other 11 jurors were also questioned during the hearing about T.L.\u2019s\n\ncomments. Three of the other jurors stated that they were unaware of the comments\n\nand all the remaining jurors denied that T.L.\u2019s comments impacted their decision.\n\n       {\u00b659} The trial court found that Smothers was not prejudiced by the juror\n\nmisconduct as all 12 jurors testified that T.L.\u2019s alleged experiment with an infrared\n\ncamera at home did not influence their decisions.\n\n       {\u00b660} This appeal followed.\n\n                                     II. Analysis\n\n    A. The Trial Court did not Err by Denying the Motion to Suppress\n\n       {\u00b661} Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of\n\nlaw and fact. State v. Burnside, 2003-Ohio-5372, \u00b6 8. The trial court\u2014the trier of fact\n\nat a suppression hearing\u2014is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and\n\nevaluate witness credibility. Id. A reviewing court must defer to the trial court\u2019s factual\n\nfindings if competent, credible evidence exists to support them. Id.\n\n       {\u00b662} We review a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress de novo. Id.;\n\nState v. Calo-Jiminez, 2023-Ohio-2562, \u00b6 27 (1st Dist.). We must accept the facts as\n\ntrue and, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, independently\n\ndetermine whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard. Id.\n\n                             The Automobile Exception\n\n       {\u00b663} The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I,\n\n\n                                            19\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nSection 14 of the Ohio Constitution protects individuals against unreasonable searches\n\nand seizures by the government where an individual has a reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy. See State v. Evenson, 2022-Ohio-1336, \u00b6 31 (1st Dist.) (The Fourth\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be\n\nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\n\nseizures.\u201d); Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 740 (1979) (the application of the Fourth\n\nAmendment depends on whether the person invoking its protection can claim a\n\njustifiable, reasonable, legitimate expectation of privacy that has been invaded by\n\ngovernment action). An expectation of privacy exists where an individual has\n\nmanifested a subjective expectation of privacy and that expectation is one that society\n\nrecognizes as reasonable. State v. Barnes, 2017-Ohio-7284, \u00b6 9 (3d Dist.); see Smith\n\nat 740. While the Fourth Amendment does not specifically provide that unlawful\n\nsearches and seizures will result in the suppression of ill-gotten evidence, the United\n\nStates Supreme Court has held that the exclusion of evidence is an essential part of the\n\nFourth Amendment. Id.; see Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 649 (1961).\n\n       {\u00b664} Smothers contests the seizure of his car from Grant County, Kentucky,\n\narguing that the affidavit that was signed by the judge failed to cite specific reasons\n\nwhy the police believed Smothers\u2019 car contained any evidence of the crime. This\n\nargument is meritless as the bases stated in the affidavit were that L.S. was found\n\ndeceased, Sharonville police had previously been called to Smothers\u2019 residence for a\n\ndomestic dispute, there were reports of \u201cyelling and fighting\u201d coming from the\n\nSmotherses trailer followed by \u201ca loud bang\u201d hours before L.S.\u2019s body was discovered,\n\nthere were drag marks and a trail of blood leading from the dumpster back to the\n\nSmotherses trailer, and Smothers left the scene in his car, which could contain\n\nevidence of L.S.\u2019s murder.\n\n\n                                          20\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b665} Smothers also argues that the affidavit contained a materially false\n\nstatement because it stated that his car was at the Sharonville Police Department when\n\nthe judge signed the warrant while his car was actually in Grant County, Kentucky. The\n\ntrial court, however, determined that Smothers\u2019 car was searched pursuant to the\n\nautomobile exception to the search-warrant requirement, not the search warrant.\n\n       {\u00b666} Under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, officers\n\nmay search a vehicle without obtaining a warrant when they have probable cause to\n\nbelieve the vehicle contains evidence of illegal activity. State v. Jackson, 2022-Ohio-\n\n4365, \u00b6 28. Probable cause is \u201ca belief, reasonably arising out of circumstances known\n\nto the seizing officer, that an automobile or other vehicle contains that which by law is\n\nsubject to seizure and destruction.\u201d State v. Turner, 2016-Ohio-7983, \u00b6 24 (2d Dist.),\n\nquoting State v. Kessler, 53 Ohio St.2d 204, 208 (1978). An automobile may be seized\n\nfrom private property and searched. See State v. Parsons, 2017-Ohio-1315, \u00b6 25 (3d\n\nDist.); State v. Miller, 2007-Ohio-6909, \u00b6 19 (4th Dist.); United States v. Graham, 275\n\nF.3d 490, 509 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\n       {\u00b667} While courts have historically held that the legality of a search\n\nconducted under the automobile exception turns on the mobility of the vehicle, see\n\nTurner at \u00b6 22; Parsons at \u00b626, 28; Graham at 509, recent holdings reflect that\n\nmobility is no longer a factor. The Sixth Circuit recently held:\n\n       Where probable cause exists, \u2018officers may conduct a warrantless search\n\n       of the vehicle, even after it has been impounded and is in police custody.\u2019\n\n       Michigan v. Thomas, 458 U.S. 259, 261 . . . (1982) (per curiam). \u2018There\n\n       is no requirement that the warrantless search of a vehicle occur\n\n       contemporaneously with its lawful seizure.\u2019 United States v. Johns, 469\n\n       U.S. 478, 484 . . . (1985). \u2018[N]or does it depend upon a reviewing court\u2019s\n\n\n                                           21\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       assessment of the likelihood . . . that the car would have been driven\n\n       away, or that its contents would have been tampered with, during the\n\n       period required for the police to obtain a warrant.\u2019 Thomas, 458 U.S. at\n\n       261. Only probable cause is required because \u2018the \u201cautomobile\n\n       exception\u201d has no separate exigency requirement.\u2019 Maryland v. Dyson,\n\n       527 U.S. 465, 466-67 . . . (1999).\n\nUnited States v. Vance, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 33034, *12-13 (6th Cir. Nov. 4, 2021),\n\nquoting California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S. 565, 579-580 (1991); see State v. Warnick,\n\n2020-Ohio-4240, \u00b6 30 (2d Dist.), quoting State v. Russell, 2004-Ohio-1700, \u00b6 34 (2d\n\nDist.) (Generally, \u201c[t]he immobilization of the vehicle or low probability of its being\n\nmoved or evidence being destroyed does not remove the officers\u2019 justification to\n\nconduct a search pursuant to the automobile exception.\u201d); In re L.S., 2016-Ohio-5582,\n\n\u00b6 10 (1st Dist.) (An inventory search of a lawfully-impounded vehicle is an exception\n\nto the general prohibition against warrantless searches; constitutionally, there is no\n\ndifference between seizing and holding a vehicle while waiting for a search warrant\n\nand immediately searching the vehicle, so long as probable cause exists.).\n\n               Probable Cause Existed to Search Smothers\u2019 Car\n\n       {\u00b668} Probable cause was evident from the facts and as reflected in the\n\naffidavit for the search warrant. Further, yellowish fluid was found near the steps of\n\nthe Smotherses trailer, surveillance footage from a neighbor depicted someone\n\ndragging \u201csomething heavy\u201d from the Smotherses lot, and a trash bag was recovered\n\nfrom the dumpster containing L.S.\u2019s soiled underwear and Smothers\u2019 mail. There was\n\nprobable cause to believe that the car contained evidence related to L.S.\u2019s murder, as\n\npolice suspected that Smothers was the person dragging the body on the neighbor\u2019s\n\nsurveillance video and he had left the scene in his car.\n\n\n                                            22\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n        {\u00b669} The Grant County Sheriff\u2019s Office received the broadcast from\n\nSharonville police to be on the lookout for Smothers and his car, which was potentially\n\nat his father\u2019s address. That, coupled with the NCIC warrant, involved the Grant\n\nCounty Sheriff\u2019s Office in a common investigation with the Sharonville police. Thus,\n\nthe seizure did not run afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment because police are\n\npermitted to rely on the collective knowledge of officers in a common investigation to\n\nestablish probable cause for a stop and arrest. State v. Fisher, 2024-Ohio-3164, \u00b6 18\n\n(1st Dist.).\n\n        {\u00b670} As the trial court found that the search was legal under the automobile\n\nexception and we agree, we decline to address the validity of the search warrant.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err by overruling Smothers\u2019 motion to suppress.\n\nSmothers\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n B. The State\u2019s Comments did not Amount to Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n        {\u00b671} In determining whether prosecutorial misconduct has occurred, the test\n\nis whether (1) the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper, and, if so, (2) \u201cwhether they\n\nprejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d State v. Howard, 2014-Ohio-\n\n655, \u00b6 31 (1st Dist.), quoting State v. Jones, 2012-Ohio-5677, \u00b6 200. The test gauges\n\nthe fairness of the trial versus the culpability of the prosecutor. State v. Godfrey, 2025-\n\nOhio-1575, \u00b6 20 (1st Dist.); see Jones at \u00b6 200. Prosecutorial misconduct only creates\n\nreversible error when it deprives the defendant of a fair trial. Godfrey at \u00b6 20; see State\n\nv. Knuff, 2024-Ohio-902, \u00b6 238, quoting United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 511-\n\n512 (1983) (new trial unwarranted despite prosecutor\u2019s improper argument because\n\nof \u201coverwhelming evidence of guilt and the inconsistency of the scanty evidence\n\ntendered by the defendants\u201d). The remarks must be evaluated in the context of the\n\nentire trial rather than individually. Godfrey at \u00b6 20. Under this test, defendant must\n\n\n                                            23\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\ndemonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the prosecutor\u2019s\n\nmisconduct, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. See id.\n\n                          Referring to Smothers as a Liar\n\n        {\u00b672} Smothers argues that the State made inflammatory comments during\n\ncross-examination and closing arguments and shifted the burden of proof to Smothers\n\nby calling him a liar and implying that defense counsel concealed facts. As Smothers\n\nfailed to object to the State\u2019s references to him as a liar, this issue is reviewed for plain\n\nerror. Plain error does not exist unless it can be said that but for the error, the outcome\n\nof the trial would clearly have been otherwise. State v. Grubbs, 2025-Ohio-2756, \u00b6 60\n\n(1st Dist.).\n\n        {\u00b673} Smothers cites to State v. Hall, 2019-Ohio-2985 (1st Dist.), in which this\n\ncourt held that prosecutors must not vouch for the credibility of the witnesses or\n\nexpress a personal opinion as to the guilt of the accused, and the prosecutor\u2019s\n\nreferences to the defendant as a \u201cwolf\u201d and \u201cpredator\u201d without physical evidence\n\nprejudiced the jury against the defendant. Id. at \u00b6 29-39. The instant case, however, is\n\ndistinguishable from Hall.\n\n        {\u00b674} Although prosecutors may not state their personal beliefs regarding\n\nguilt and credibility, they may characterize a witness as a liar, or claim the witness lied,\n\nif the evidence reasonably supports that characterization. Grubbs at \u00b6 83. The State\n\ncalling Smothers a liar was supported by the evidence. Smothers admitted that he lied\n\nwhen he cheated on his previous wives and L.S., and when he told the police that he\n\nwas going to work when he left his trailer when his true intention was to drive to his\n\nfather\u2019s house in Williamstown, Kentucky. As discussed below, Smothers\u2019 conviction\n\nis supported by the remaining evidence. The characterization as a liar, therefore, did\n\nnot the outcome of the trial.\n\n\n                                             24\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n    Smothers\u2019 Newly-Raised Theory at Trial that a Stranger Killed L.S.\n\n       {\u00b675} Smothers asserts he was prejudiced by the line of questioning regarding\n\nhis assertion that a stranger killed L.S., and the trial court\u2019s failure to rule on Smothers\u2019\n\nmotion for a mistrial prejudiced him by shifting the burden of proof to him. Smothers\n\nobjected to the State\u2019s questions concerning Smothers\u2019 assertion that a stranger killed\n\nL.S., but the trial court allowed cross-examination to proceed after cautioning the\n\nState it was \u201ctreading\u201d a \u201cdelicate line.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b676} In Knuff, the Ohio Supreme Court found a number of the prosecutor\u2019s\n\ncomments to be improper, but ultimately determined that, except for a statement that\n\nwas objected to, which was sustained, the comments were harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt because \u201cthe overwhelming evidence of Knuff\u2019s guilt\u201d was such that\n\neven if the comments had not been made, it was \u201cclear beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nthe jury would have returned a verdict of guilty.\u201d Knuff, 2024-Ohio-902, at \u00b6 246-247.\n\n                   Post-Arrest Silence can be Used for Impeachment\n\n       {\u00b677} The State argues that Smothers\u2019 post-arrest silence\u2014his failure to assert\n\nthe theory that a stranger killed his wife\u2014could be used to impeach his version of the\n\nevents since he testified in his own defense. The State\u2019s argument has merit. Ohio\n\ncourts have consistently held that while prearrest silence may not be used as\n\nsubstantive evidence of guilt, it can be used to impeach a defendant\u2019s testimony at trial\n\nbecause it \u201cfurthers the truth-seeking process.\u201d State v. Leach, 2004-Ohio-2147, \u00b6 33;\n\nState v. Slusarczyk, 2024-Ohio-4790, \u00b6 30 (8th Dist.); State v. Hodge, 2022-Ohio-\n\n1780, \u00b6 32 (2d Dist.). Here, there is no indication that the State\u2019s use of Smothers\u2019 post-\n\narrest silence to impeach his testimony on a new defense theory prejudiced Smothers.\n\n                           The State\u2019s Closing Arguments\n\n       {\u00b678} The State\u2019s remarks during closing arguments are also reviewed for\n\n\n                                             25\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nplain error as Smothers failed to object to the State\u2019s comments that (1) Smothers\n\n\u201cfooled\u201d the jury by testifying that he was going through L.S.\u2019s phone \u201cwhile going to\n\nthe toilet,\u201d (2) Smothers had four years to \u201cconcoct a story and come up with\n\nsomething plausible\u201d that someone else killed L.S., and (3) defense counsel\u2019s assertion\n\nthat there was evidence that should have been tested did not explain L.S.\u2019s blood being\n\non the green towel and Smothers\u2019 clothing. Smothers asserts these comments were\n\nimproper and improperly shifted the burden of proof to Smothers because it implied\n\nthat Smothers and his counsel were not being truthful.\n\n       {\u00b679} In State v. Truesdell, 2024-Ohio-5376 (1st Dist.), the appellant took\n\nissue with the prosecutor\u2019s statement:\n\n       Man, the way you hear [defense counsel] talk, I\u2019d have to prove this pool\n\n       actually existed or that he went to a specific casino. That\u2019s defense\n\n       smoke and mirrors . . . That\u2019s why I want you to pay attention to the\n\n       evidence. Don\u2019t pay attention to anything else that\u2019s a red herring . . .\n\n       Because the defense wants you to believe [G.M.\u2019s] own messed up\n\n       timeline . . . .\n\nId. at \u00b6 41. This court held that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were made in response to\n\ndefense counsel\u2019s argument and were based on the evidence. Id.\n\n       {\u00b680} The same reasoning applies here. The prosecutor made the comments\n\nto refute Smothers\u2019 assertion that the State\u2019s evidence did not support a finding that\n\nhe killed L.S., or his assertion that a stranger killed her. The prosecutor\u2019s comments\n\nthat the defense was concocting a story and questioning the untested sexual-assault\n\nkit in the face of the remaining evidence were also made to refute Smothers\u2019 theory of\n\ndefense. The prosecutor\u2019s comments, therefore, were based on the evidence and did\n\nnot amount to prosecutorial misconduct. Further, Smothers fails to show how the\n\n\n                                          26\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\ncomments shifted the burden of proof to him, or that he would not have been convicted\n\nif the prosecutor had not made the comments. Additionally, the trial court instructed\n\nthe jury that closing arguments are not evidence.\n\n       {\u00b681} Smothers\u2019 second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                          C. The Autopsy Photographs\n\n       {\u00b682} Smothers asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting\n\ninflammatory, gruesome, repetitive, and cumulative photographs of L.S., and that it\n\nunfairly inflamed the passions of the jury. The State counters that the photographs\n\nthat were admitted illustrated the coroner\u2019s testimony about the condition of L.S.\u2019s\n\nbody and depicted the cause of death. It further argues that Smothers has not\n\ndemonstrated undue prejudice.\n\n       {\u00b683} The admission or exclusion of evidence is generally committed to the\n\nsound discretion of the trial court. State v. Miller, 2002-Ohio-3296, \u00b6 13-15 (1st Dist.).\n\nGruesome photographs are admissible at trial if their probative value outweighs the\n\ndanger that the accused will be unfairly prejudiced. Id.\n\n       {\u00b684} Under Evid.R. 403, a trial court must reject an otherwise admissible\n\nphotograph where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice, and the trial court may reject an otherwise admissible photograph\n\nwhere its probative value is substantially outweighed by its cumulative nature. A\n\nphotograph is not inadmissible merely because it is gruesome. Knuff, 2024-Ohio-902,\n\nat \u00b6 172, quoting State v. Kirkland, 2020-Ohio-4079, \u00b6 101, quoting State v. Maurer,\n\n15 Ohio St.3d 239 (1984). (\u201cProperly authenticated photographs, even if gruesome, are\n\nadmissible in a [prosecution] if relevant and of probative value in assisting the trier of\n\nfact to determine the issues or are illustrative of testimony and other evidence, as long\n\nas the danger of material prejudice to a defendant is outweighed by their probative\n\n\n                                           27\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nvalue and the photographs are not repetitive or cumulative in number.\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b685} In Knuff, the trial court admitted 51 photographs the defense\n\nconsidered to be gruesome because it showed the deterioration of the victims\u2019 bodies.\n\nKnuff at \u00b6 174. The Court disagreed because the fact of decomposition was relevant to\n\nthe coroner\u2019s findings. Id. The Court, concluding that the photographs illustrated the\n\nmedical examiner\u2019s testimony, documented her handling of the bodies, and showed\n\nthe victims\u2019 numerous stab wounds, held that the fact of decomposition was relevant\n\nto the coroner\u2019s findings. Id. The Court determined that the photographs were not\n\nrepetitive or cumulative as each were depicted twice to show the location of each\n\nwound with a close-up to show the characteristics of the wounds, and both bodies were\n\nphotographed from several different angles. Id. at \u00b6 175. The Court held that each\n\nphotograph possessed unique probative value, thus, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in deciding that the admission of the photographs did not materially\n\nprejudice appellant. Id. at \u00b6 176.\n\n       {\u00b686} Here, the State offered approximately 48 photos of L.S.\u2019s autopsy during\n\nDr. Looman\u2019s testimony, which was offered to support the elements of murder and\n\ngross abuse of a corpse. Like in Knuff, the photographs were not inadmissible simply\n\nbecause they were gruesome, nor were they cumulative or repetitive where multiple\n\nphotographs of the same area of L.S.\u2019s body showed different injuries to those areas.\n\nThe photographs depicting postmortem injuries were introduced to show that those\n\ninjuries were caused by dragging her body through the snow after she died, and that\n\nher body later froze solid due to weather conditions. Some of the photographs were\n\nintroduced to show that the body had been thawed so the autopsy could be performed.\n\nSmothers\u2019 argument is meritless as each photograph was presented to corroborate Dr.\n\nLooman\u2019s testimony that L.S. suffered multiple injuries due to being beaten from head\n\n\n                                         28\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nto toe and strangled to death.\n\n       {\u00b687} The trial admission of the photographs, therefore, was not arbitrary,\n\nunreasonable, or unconscionable. As Smothers failed to show the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in admitting the photographs, his third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                     D. Sufficiency and Manifest Weight\n\n       {\u00b688} Smothers argues his convictions for murder, gross abuse of a corpse,\n\nand tampering with evidence were based on insufficient evidence. While not explicitly\n\nstated in this assignment of error, Smothers also argues that his convictions should be\n\noverturned as they are contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n      Smothers\u2019 Convictions were Supported by Sufficient Evidence.\n\n       {\u00b689} A challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence tasks the reviewing court\n\nwith determining whether the State satisfied its burden of production. State v. Harper,\n\n2025-Ohio-2059, \u00b6 12 (1st Dist.). To determine whether a conviction is supported by\n\nsufficient evidence, we \u201cassess whether, construing the evidence in a light most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the necessary\n\nelements of a given crime to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v.\n\nRodriguez, 2024-Ohio-5832, \u00b6 8 (1st Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b690} Circumstantial evidence and direct evidence inherently possess the\n\nsame probative value and therefore should be subjected to the same standard of proof.\n\nState v. Robinson, 2023-Ohio-2312, \u00b6 19 (1st Dist.). Direct evidence exists when a\n\nwitness testifies about a matter within the witness\u2019 personal knowledge such that the\n\ntrier of fact is not required to draw an inference from the evidence to the proposition\n\nthat it is offered to establish. State v. Jones, 2024-Ohio-1987, \u00b6 24 (8th Dist.). In\n\ncontrast, circumstantial evidence requires the drawing of inferences that are\n\nreasonably permitted by the evidence. Id. Circumstantial evidence is the proof of facts\n\n\n                                          29\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nby direct evidence from which the trier of fact may infer or derive by reasoning other\n\nfacts in accordance with the common experience of mankind. Id. Circumstantial\n\nevidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction if that evidence would convince the\n\naverage mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Robinson at \u00b6 19.\n\n       {\u00b691} Smothers was convicted of murder, gross abuse of a corpse, and\n\ntampering with evidence. To prove murder, the state had to show that Smothers\n\npurposely caused L.S.\u2019s death. R.C. 2903.02(A). To prove gross abuse of a corpse, the\n\nState had to show that Smothers treated L.S.\u2019s corpse in a way that would outrage\n\nreasonable community sensibilities. R.C. 2927.01(B). To prove tampering with\n\nevidence, the State had to show that Smothers altered, destroyed, concealed, or\n\nremoved any items related to the crime \u201cwith purpose to impair its value or availability\n\nas evidence\u201d knowing that an investigation was in progress. R.C. 2921.12(A)(1).\n\n       {\u00b692} In determining who strangled L.S. to death, the evidence consisted of\n\nSmothers\u2019 blood on L.S.\u2019s purse, Smothers having fresh scratches on his face when he\n\nwas arrested, his DNA found under L.S.\u2019s fingernails, and L.S.\u2019s blood that was found\n\non the pants and boots Smothers was wearing when he was arrested\u2014which matched\n\nthe boot prints in the drag marks in the snow. The jacket Smothers was wearing when\n\nhe was arrested resembled the jacket worn by the figure in the neighbor\u2019s surveillance\n\nvideo and L.S.\u2019s blood was found on it. Phone records indicated the neither Smothers\n\nnor L.S.\u2019s phones had been moved from the lot overnight, which is evidence that\n\nneither of them left the trailer while L.S. was still alive and refutes Smothers\u2019\n\nsuggestion that L.S. went to be with R.P. at any point that night.\n\n       {\u00b693} The coroner testified that the antemortem injuries showed that L.S. died\n\nby strangulation after being beaten, and the postmortem marks and tracks in the snow\n\nleading from the Smotherses trailer lot to the dumpster showed that L.S. was dragged\n\n\n                                          30\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nto the dumpster from where the Smotherses lived. A neighbor\u2019s video captured a figure\n\ndragging what Smothers conceded was L.S.\u2019s body between the Smotherses lot and the\n\ndumpster prior to it being discovered. Dragging a deceased person and leaving her\n\nnaked, beaten, and bloodied body in a place where it is easily discoverable\u2014by her\n\nneighbors no less\u2014is certainly enough to outrage reasonable community sensibilities.\n\n       {\u00b694} A white trash bag matching those found in the Smothers\u2019 trailer\n\ncontaining the Smotherses mail and L.S.\u2019s soiled underwear was found in the\n\ndumpster. L.S.\u2019s cell phone was found in Smothers\u2019 car along with towels that had\n\nL.S.\u2019s blood on them. Coupled with the other evidence, it is sufficient to show that\n\nSmothers tampered with evidence related to L.S.\u2019s murder.\n\n       {\u00b695} The State, therefore, presented sufficient evidence to prove that\n\nSmothers was guilty of murder, gross abuse of a corpse, and tampering with evidence\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n   Smothers\u2019 Convictions Were Not Against the Manifest Weight of the\n                              Evidence\n\n       {\u00b696} When applying the manifest-weight standard of review, a reviewing\n\ncourt reviews the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences,\n\nconsiders the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in\n\nthe evidence, the finder of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest\n\nmiscarriage of justice that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered.\n\nState v. Champion, 2021-Ohio-4002, \u00b6 14 (1st Dist.), citing State v.

The trier of\n\nfact is in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses; thus, we afford\n\nsubstantial deference to the trier of fact\u2019s credibility determinations. Id.\n\n       {\u00b698} A conviction may only be reversed under a manifest-weight review in\n\nexceptional cases where the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction. Id. A\n\nconviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence simply because the fact\n\nfinder believed the prosecution testimony. Id. Thus, a defendant is not entitled to a\n\nreversal on manifest-weight grounds merely because inconsistent evidence was\n\npresented at trial; the trier of fact is free to believe some, all, or none of any witnesses\u2019\n\ntestimony. State v. Ridley, 2022-Ohio-2561, \u00b6 25 (1st Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b699} The only evidence Smothers offered to refute the State\u2019s physical and\n\ntestimonial evidence was his own testimony painting his version of the events. It was\n\nthe jury\u2019s prerogative to believe the State\u2019s physical and testimonial evidence and\n\ndisbelieve Smothers\u2019 testimony, particularly that a stranger killed L.S.\n\n       {\u00b6100} Smothers\u2019 fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                             E. The Sexual-Assault Kit\n\n       {\u00b6101} Smothers argues that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his\n\nmotion to dismiss the case based on Brady violations, including the State\u2019s failure to\n\npreserve and disclose the existence and destruction of the victim\u2019s sexual-assault kit,\n\nwhich could have been exculpatory evidence in the murder case.\n\n    Due Process, the Fourteenth Amendment, and Brady v. Maryland\n\n       {\u00b6102} The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution protects a criminal defendant from being convicted when the\n\ngovernment fails to preserve materially exculpatory evidence or when it destroys\n\nevidence in bad faith that is potentially useful to the defense. State v. Palmer, 2023-\n\n\n                                             32\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nOhio-1554, \u00b6 9 (1st Dist.); State v. Brown, 2019-Ohio-1615, \u00b6 10 (1st Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b6103} A Brady violation occurs when the State fails to disclose evidence\n\nmaterially favorable to the accused. State v. Bevins, 2006-Ohio-6974, \u00b6 47. Evidence\n\nsuppressed by the State is material within the meaning of Brady only if a reasonable\n\nprobability exists that the result of the trial would have been different had the evidence\n\nbeen disclosed to the defense. Id. \u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed\n\ninformation might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the\n\ntrial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d Id. A due-process\n\nviolation does not result from the State\u2019s failure to preserve evidence \u201cof which no\n\nmore could be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which\n\nmight have exonerated the defendant.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 48.\n\n                               Exculpatory Evidence\n\n       {\u00b6104} Evidence is materially exculpatory if it (1) \u201cpossesses \u2018an exculpatory\n\nvalue that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed\u2019\u201d and (2) is \u201c\u2018of such a\n\nnature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other\n\nreasonably available means.\u2019\u201d Palmer at \u00b6 10, quoting State v. Powell, 2012-Ohio-\n\n2577, \u00b6 74, quoting California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 489, (1984). \u201cThe\n\npossibility that [evidentiary material] could have exculpated [the defendant]\n\nif preserved or tested is not enough to satisfy the standard of constitutional\n\nmateriality.\u201d Id., quoting Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 56.\n\n       {\u00b6105} Materially exculpatory evidence can include evidence that has an\n\nexculpatory value solely because of its tendency to impeach the credibility of a\n\ngovernment witness. Id. at \u00b6 11; see United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676 (1985);\n\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 280-282 (1999). Generally, the defendant bears the\n\nburden to show that the evidence was materially exculpatory. Id. at \u00b6 12; Powell at \u00b6\n\n\n                                           33\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n74; Brown, 2019-Ohio-1615, at \u00b6 12 (1st Dist.).\n\n       {\u00b6106} However, this court has previously held that the burden shifts to the to\n\nthe State show the evidence was \u201csolely inculpatory\u201d if the defendant requests\n\npreservation of the evidence and the State subsequently fails to preserve it. Id.; see\n\nBrown at \u00b6 12.\n\n                            Potentially-Useful Evidence\n\n       {\u00b6107} If the missing evidence is not materially exculpatory, but \u201cpotentially\n\nuseful,\u201d then a different rule applies. Brown at \u00b6 15, quoting Powell, 2012-Ohio-2577,\n\nat \u00b6 77. Unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure\n\nto preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of\n\nlaw. Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 58. \u201cThe term bad faith generally implies something\n\nmore than bad judgment or negligence.\u201d (Internal citations and quotations omitted.)\n\nPowell at \u00b6 81. \u201cIt imports a dishonest purpose, moral obliquity, conscious\n\nwrongdoing, breach of a known duty through some ulterior motive or ill will partaking\n\nof the nature of fraud.\u201d Id. \u201cIt also embraces actual intent to mislead or deceive\n\nanother.\u201d Id.\n\n       {\u00b6108} An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss\n\nto determine whether the State failed to preserve materially exculpatory evidence or\n\ndestroyed potentially useful evidence in bad faith de novo. Brown, 2019-Ohio-1615, at\n\n\u00b6 9 (1st Dist.). \u201cBad faith\u201d suggests actions based on more than bad judgment or\n\nnegligence. State v. Nicholson, 2024-Ohio-604, \u00b6 118. In Nicholson, the Ohio Supreme\n\nCourt stated that it had \u201cnever held that bad faith can be inferred based simply on the\n\nstate\u2019s failure to preserve potentially useful evidence.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 119.\n\n       {\u00b6109} Smothers argues that this court\u2019s holding in State v. Green, 2024-Ohio-\n\n3260 (1st Dist.), supports his proposition that the destruction of the sexual-assault kit\n\n\n                                            34\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nundermines confidence in Smothers\u2019 murder conviction and creates a reasonable\n\nprobability of acquittal had it been properly disclosed. In Green, this court held that\n\nthe disclosure of the police department\u2019s incident report, which only referenced the\n\nrecorded statement of a witness, did not give sufficient notice because the summary of\n\nthe recording failed to sufficiently apprise the defense that it revealed that the witness\n\nand appellant had work-related issues, which would serve to impeach the witness\u2019\n\ntestimony at trial. Id. at \u00b6 23, 26-29. This court held that the State unlawfully withheld\n\nthe recording where it is required to disclose material evidence in its possession that\n\nis favorable to the defense. Id. at \u00b6 30-31.\n\n       {\u00b6110} Although Smothers filed a request to preserve evidence and requested\n\nthat exculpatory evidence be turned over to him, he has not shown that the results\n\nfrom the untested sexual-assault kit had exculpatory value that was apparent before\n\nthe evidence was destroyed. Smothers\u2019 theory that the untested kit was exculpatory\n\nwas a mere possibility and therefore, not enough to satisfy the standard of\n\nconstitutional materiality. In other words, ascertaining whether L.S. had another\n\nsexual partner has no apparent exculpatory value, and, as Smothers knew this other\n\nalleged sexual partner by name, he could have obtained comparable evidence by other\n\nreasonably available means. Further, the testimonial evidence confirmed that the\n\npolice investigated other potential suspects, but there was no evidence tying any other\n\npersons to the crime.\n\n The Untested Kit Would Have Been Potentially Useful, Not Exculpatory\n\n       {\u00b6111} Dr. Looman testified that it is common for a strangulated victim to fight\n\nwith their assailant, including scratching to fend off the assailant. The only DNA found\n\non L.S.\u2019s body belonged to her and Smothers, and the lab results revealed that only his\n\nDNA was under her fingernails. The testimonial evidence revealed that L.S. struggled\n\n\n                                               35\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nwith her assailant, and Smothers had \u201cfresh\u201d scratch marks on his face when he was\n\narrested\u2014the same day L.S.\u2019s body was discovered. As the State argues, and as Dr.\n\nLooman testified, any information from the DNA kit would be speculative; even if DNA\n\nwere found to show she had sexual relations with someone else, Smothers fails to show\n\nhow that would impeach Dr. Looman\u2019s testimony.\n\n       {\u00b6112} The destroyed sexual-assault kit fits the \u201cpotentially useful\u201d category.\n\nDr. Looman testified she only collected samples for the sexual-assault kit as a\n\nprecaution due to the undressed state of the body and because she would not be able\n\nto collect samples once the body left the coroner\u2019s office. The autopsy revealed,\n\nhowever, that L.S. had not been sexually assaulted. Dr. Looman admitted that\n\ndestroying the kit was a \u201cmistake,\u201d which is akin to \u201cbad judgment\u201d or \u201cnegligence.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding statutory requirements or in-house policies governing the\n\nmaintenance of such kits, Dr. Looman testified that she did not know Smothers or L.S.\n\npersonally, the sexual-assault kit was destroyed solely for storage reasons as the office\n\nwas moving to a new location, and she acted unilaterally and did not notify the\n\nprosecutor or the police that she was destroying the kit. Smothers, therefore, failed to\n\nshow the coroner destroyed the sexual-assault kit in bad faith; he provided no evidence\n\nof \u201cdishonest purpose, moral obliquity, conscious wrongdoing, breach of a known duty\n\nthrough some ulterior motive or ill will partaking of the nature of fraud.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6113} The instant case, therefore, is distinguishable from Green. The State did\n\nnot knowingly withhold evidence in its possession that could be favorable to Smothers\u2019\n\ndefense. Whether results of the untested kit would be favorable to Smothers\u2019 defense\n\nis purely speculative. Ultimately, Smothers failed to show that his due-process rights\n\nwere violated by the destruction of potentially-useful evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6114} Smothers\u2019 fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n                                           36\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n                        F. Adverse-Inference Instruction\n\n         {\u00b6115} Smothers argues that the trial court erred by not giving his proposed\n\nadverse-inference jury instruction regarding the State\u2019s destruction and nontesting of\n\nthe sexual-assault kit. A trial court must give the defendant\u2019s requested instructions to\n\nthe jury if they are correct, pertinent statements of law and are appropriate under the\n\nfacts of the case. State v. Houston, 2020-Ohio-5421, \u00b6 34 (1st Dist.). Such an\n\ninstruction is provided where there is a showing of the other party\u2019s malfeasance or\n\ngross neglect. State v. O.E.P.-T., 2023-Ohio-2035, \u00b6 90 (10th Dist.); see Crim.R.\n\n30(A).\n\n         {\u00b6116} We review a trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a defendant\u2019s\n\nproposed jury instruction for an abuse of discretion. Id. A reviewing court will not\n\nreverse a criminal conviction due to jury instructions unless the defendant was\n\nprejudiced. State v. Standifer, 2012-Ohio-3132, \u00b6 53 (12th Dist.).\n\n         {\u00b6117} Smothers asserted that the destruction of the sexual-assault kit during\n\nthe pendency of the case was gross negligence and requested that the trial court\n\ninstruct the jury pursuant to Crim.R. 30(A). Smothers asserted that the destruction of\n\nthe kit was intentional, and an adverse instruction could permit the jury to draw an\n\ninference unfavorable to the State, which had control of the evidence.\n\n         {\u00b6118} While addressing Smothers\u2019 proposed jury instruction at sidebar, the\n\ntrial court raised the fact that Smothers\u2019 first two teams of attorneys sought the\n\nstrangulation kit\u2014but not the sexual-assault kit\u2014based on the initial defense theory\n\nthat while Smothers \u201cdid indeed strangle\u201d L.S., it occurred by accident while the couple\n\nwas having sex. The court highlighted that, pursuant to that theory, Smothers sought\n\nexpert testimony based on the strangulation kit and asserted that he was entitled to a\n\nnot-guilty verdict based on his initial defense theory. The court pointed to the fact that\n\n\n                                           37\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nSmothers, however, did not seek a sexual-assault kit, which was available at the time\n\nhe requested the strangulation kit. As the court reiterated, \u201cat no time was the rape kit\n\nzeroed in\u201d between 2018 and 2020 as the trial was pending. The court noted that the\n\ndefense theory changed with the change of counsel, and it \u201crealized [that] theories\n\nchange,\u201d but it could not find malfeasance or gross neglect regarding the destruction\n\nof the sexual-assault kit.4\n\n        {\u00b6119} Here, the State provided a satisfactory explanation for the destruction\n\nof the kit\u2014it was due to the need for storage space where there was no allegation of\n\nsexual assault. There is no dispute that R.C. 2933.82 requires evidence in criminal\n\ncases to be stored until either the case is resolved or 30 years following a conviction,\n\nand the coroner\u2019s policy that the evidence remains stored in case a defendant is\n\ngranted a new trial. The trial court finding, however, that there was no malfeasance or\n\ngross neglect was supported by Dr. Looman\u2019s testimony that the decision was a\n\nmistake and was based on storage purposes versus some malicious intent to affect\n\nSmothers\u2019 defense. Even if the trial court erred by rejecting Smothers\u2019 proposed jury\n\ninstruction, Smothers fails to show how the results of a test of the sexual-assault kit\n\nwould have changed the outcome of the trial. Smothers\u2019 sixth assignment of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                  G. Juror Misconduct\n\n        {\u00b6120} Smothers argues that the trial court abused its discretion by overruling\n\nhis motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct. He asserts that he demonstrated\n\nthat he was presumptively prejudiced by juror misconduct that occurred during\n\ndeliberations and, therefore, was entitled to a new trial.\n\n\n\n4 Of note, the court also denied the State\u2019s request for a flight instruction regarding Smothers\n\ntraveling to his father\u2019s home.\n\n\n                                              38\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b6121} When reviewing a motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct, an\n\nappellate court must conduct a two-tier analysis: (1) determine whether there was\n\njuror misconduct and (2) if juror misconduct is found, determine whether it materially\n\naffected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. State v. McGail, 2021-Ohio-231, \u00b6 27 (2d\n\nDist.). The burden is on the party alleging juror misconduct to establish prejudice.\n\nState v. Adams, 2004-Ohio-5845, \u00b6 42. The Adams Court stated, \u201cWe have repeatedly\n\nrejected [the proposition that all juror misconduct is rebuttably presumed to be\n\nprejudicial] and have held that a reviewing court will not reverse a judgment based on\n\njuror misconduct unless the complaining party demonstrates prejudice.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 195.\n\n       {\u00b6122} A trial court may rely on a juror\u2019s testimony in determining whether\n\njuror misconduct affected their impartiality. State v. Dukes, 2019-Ohio-2893, \u00b6 19 (9th\n\nDist.). A trial court is entitled to believe or disbelieve all or part of the jurors\u2019\n\nstatements in determining whether there was juror misconduct. Id.\n\n       {\u00b6123} Here, the misconduct regarded a juror\u2019s statement to other jurors that\n\nshe saw that the colors of objects were inverse on her own surveillance camera. Each\n\njuror\u2014except for the three jurors who testified that they were unaware of any\n\nexperiment\u2014testified that his or her findings were not based on that statement. Some\n\ntestified that the issue of the infrared camera\u2019s effect on colors was discussed and\n\nresolved before the juror made the comment. The trial court was entitled to believe the\n\njurors\u2019 testimonies. It based its decision to overrule Smothers\u2019 motion for a new trial\n\non each juror\u2019s testimony. Smothers, therefore, failed to meet his burden to show the\n\nalleged misconduct was prejudicial.\n\n       {\u00b6124} Smothers\u2019 seventh assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                  III.

They were responding to a report that the nude body of a\n\nwoman was lying behind a dumpster near one of the trailers.1 While police were\n\nconducting their investigation, defendant-appellant Brian Smothers came out of his\n\ntrailer. Smothers explained to the officers that he needed to leave for work and asked\n\nif the police and emergency vehicles blocking his car could be moved. Smothers\u2019\n\nrequest was accommodated, the vehicles were moved, and he drove off\u2014but not to\n\nwork. Instead, Smothers drove to his father\u2019s home in Grant County, Kentucky.\n\n        {\u00b62}     After Smothers drove off, the investigating officers learned that the dead\n\nwoman was Smothers\u2019 wife, L.S. A police broadcast was made to be on the lookout for\n\nSmothers and the dark blue Hyundai Santa Fe he was driving, and warrants were\n\nissued for his arrest and for the search of his car. When the police broadcast reached\n\nthe Grant County Sheriff\u2019s Office, they sent an officer to the house of Smothers\u2019 father,\n\nwhere Smothers was found and arrested. Smothers\u2019 car was parked in the driveway of\n\nhis father\u2019s house.

Virginia\">Id. at\n\n600</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Smothers asserted that the affidavit in support of the warrant was defective\n\nbecause his car was not located in the jurisdiction of the issuing judge when the\n\nwarrant was issued on January 1, 2018. Instead, his car was at his father\u2019s home in\n\nGrant County, Kentucky. Smothers argued that the Sharonville police conducted a\n\nwarrantless search of his car because it did not arrive at the police department until\n\nJanuary 2, 2018.\n\n                      Detective Brad Hondorf\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b67}   Sharonville Police Detective Brad Hondorf assisted with the\n\ninvestigation of L.S.\u2019s death. Hondorf testified that during the initial investigation,\n\nSmothers came out of his trailer as the paramedics were leaving and asked the officers\n\nto move their cars. After they did, he left the scene. Hondorf explained that at that\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\npoint, L.S.\u2019s identity was unknown. Hondorf explained that after the police cars and\n\nemergency vehicles were moved, the officers saw \u201cdrag marks\u201d in the snow leading\n\nfrom where L.S.\u2019s body was found to Lot 15\u2014Smothers\u2019 trailer.\n\n       {\u00b68}   After searching their database, the officers learned that police had\n\nrecently responded to a report of domestic violence at the Smotherses home. Hondorf\n\nalso testified that based on previous photos, they were able to identify L.S. by her\n\n\u201cdistinct tattoos.\u201d They used a photo of Smothers to confirm his identity with the\n\nofficer whom Smothers spoke to prior to driving away. Smothers\u2019 neighbors also\n\nreported to the officers that they saw Smothers leaving in his car.\n\n       {\u00b69}   Hondorf explained that Smothers was permitted to leave because\n\nneither he nor the body of L.S. had been identified at that point. Hondorf testified that\n\nSmothers became a suspect after he had left and the officers saw the drag marks and\n\nidentified the body. He further explained that the investigators became interested in\n\nthe car after they reviewed the video from a neighbor\u2019s surveillance camera. That\n\nfootage showed a \u201csubject throughout the night going back and forth\u201d \u201cdragging\n\nsomething the size of a body,\u201d and the pathway indicated that the subject made several\n\ntrips from the dumpster to the area where Lot 15 was, including carrying what looked\n\nlike a garbage bag towards the dumpster.\n\n       {\u00b610} A warrant was issued for Smothers\u2019 arrest for abuse of a corpse. Hondorf\n\ntestified that the Grant County Sheriff\u2019s Department was notified that Smothers\u2019 father\n\nlived in that county, and on January 1, 2018, a Grant County deputy sheriff went to the\n\nhome of Smother\u2019s father where Smothers and his car were found. Hondorf explained\n\nthat Sharonville police believed that L.S.\u2019s missing clothes, blood, or other evidence\n\ncould be in Smothers\u2019 car. After Smothers was arrested, his car was impounded at the\n\nGrant County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n                                           5\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b611} During his testimony, Hondorf conceded that Smothers\u2019 car was not in\n\nHamilton County when he submitted the affidavit for a search warrant for the car on\n\nJanuary 1, 2018. He also conceded that the car did not arrive at the Sharonville Police\n\nDepartment until January 2, 2018. t. Hondorf testified, however, that the police had\n\nno intention of executing the search warrant on Smothers\u2019 car until it was in Hamilton\n\nCounty.\n\n       {\u00b612} Hondorf testified that the warrant to search Smothers\u2019 car was obtained\n\nbecause, once the car was found, it would be seized and transported to the Sharonville\n\nPolice Department to be searched for evidence. He explained that probable cause to\n\nsearch the car arose when Smothers, later identified as a suspect, had left the scene in\n\nhis car.\n\n                       Detective Scott Conrad\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b613} Detective Scott Conrad, with the Grant County Sheriff\u2019s Office, testified\n\nthat their dispatch received a call from Sharonville police asking for assistance in\n\nlocating Smothers and his car. Conrad conceded that the car was parked on private\n\nproperty when the Grant County sheriffs seized it, and they did not have a search\n\nwarrant issued by a judge in Kentucky. Conrad, however, explained that, at that point,\n\nSmothers had been charged in Grant County as a fugitive from another state, and there\n\nwas a National Crime Information Center (\u201cNCIC\u201d) warrant for his arrest.\n\n       {\u00b614} Conrad testified that the Grant County deputy sheriffs went to the\n\naddress given by Sharonville police and saw Smothers walking to the front door and\n\nhis car parked in the driveway. Conrad explained that the vehicle was not searched in\n\nGrant County and that the sheriff\u2019s office taped the doors of the car shut to ensure that\n\nit was not searched until it was in Sharonville.\n\n           The Trial Court Denies Smothers\u2019 Motion to Suppress\n\n\n                                           6\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n         {\u00b615} The trial court, referring to the \u201cOhio Arrest Search and Seizure\u201d\n\nmanual, stated that there are not \u201cany rules [under the automobile exception] that\n\nbear a magic line, at the border of Ohio, and they can\u2019t go into another jurisdiction,\n\nlike Kentucky.\u201d The court stated that \u201cthe whole idea about the auto[mobile] exception\n\nwas to give officers an opportunity to follow a very inherent mobility of a vehicle,\u201d\n\nwhich \u201ccreates circumstances of such exigency that it is practically a necessity.\u201d The\n\ncourt added that individuals have a reduced expectation of privacy where a warrantless\n\nsearch is based on probable cause. The court stated that there was probable cause to\n\nsearch Smothers\u2019 car because L.S.\u2019s body was found behind the dumpster, tracks led\n\nback to the Smotherses trailer, the video showed someone dragging something to the\n\ndumpster, and Smothers, the main suspect, left the scene in his car. The court further\n\nstated that no warrant was needed to seize the vehicle and hold it pending the search\n\nas the \u201cSupreme Court has said that a car that has been seized and brought to police\n\nheadquarters and even sits as long as two weeks, there was no need for a search\n\nwarrant.\u201d The trial court denied the motion to suppress, and the case proceeded to\n\ntrial.\n\n                                     B. The Trial\n\n                                  K.C.\u2019s Testimony\n\n         {\u00b616} K.C. testified that she knew Smothers and L.S. She testified that around\n\n9:30 a.m. on January 1, 2018, she looked outside of her window and saw a body lying\n\nby the dumpster. She stated that she went to see if the person was okay but saw red\n\nspots in the snow, that the woman was naked, and there was blood going down her\n\nchest and nose. Realizing that the woman was dead, she called 9-1-1.\n\n\n\n                           Greg Shewbridge\u2019s Testimony\n\n\n                                           7\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b617} Greg Shewbridge, an EMT with the Sharonville Fire Department,\n\ntestified that once the emergency vehicles and police cars were moved to allow\n\nSmothers to leave, an officer showed Shewbridge that there were drag marks coming\n\nfrom Trailer 15, which was the trailer that Smothers came out of and lived in.\n\nShewbridge stated that this caused him concern that \u201cthe suspect of a crime had just\n\nfled the scene.\u201d\n\n                      Officer David Landsberg\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b618} Officer Landsberg, a Cincinnati police criminalist, was called to the\n\nscene by Sharonville officers. He testified about what he observed at the scene and\n\nidentified the photographs taken at the scene as they were introduced into evidence.\n\nOfficer Landsberg described the drag marks and blood found along the trail from\n\nTrailer 15 to the dumpster and described the shoe prints found in the snow along the\n\ntrail and at the base of the steps of Trailer 15. Officer Landsberg testified that the police\n\nand medical responders were careful not to disturb the shoe imprints. Officer\n\nLandsberg also explained that there were no signs of forced entry into the trailer.\n\n       {\u00b619} Officer Landsberg also participated in the search of Smothers\u2019 car\u2014\n\nwhich had crime tape around it before the search began\u2014at the Sharonville police\n\nstation. Officer Landsberg testified that L.S.\u2019s cell phone was found on the front\n\npassenger seat, and \u201creddish stains\u201d were found on and above the dials used to adjust\n\nthe driver\u2019s seat. A navy-blue sweatshirt with different stains was found in the back of\n\nthe car along with green towels with reddish stains that were found in the trunk.\n\nOfficer Landsberg testified that the shoe print that he obtained from the floor mat of\n\nthe driver\u2019s side matched the shoe prints found on the trail of drag marks at the scene.\n\n\n\n                           Officer Lee Jacobs\u2019 Testimony\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b620} Officer Lee Jacobs testified that L.S.\u2019s purse was found in the front room\n\nof Smothers\u2019 trailer and that Smothers\u2019 blood was found on the purse strap. Officer\n\nJacobs described seeing a \u201cperson walking back and forth\u201d and what appeared to be a\n\n\u201cbody or something very large\u201d near the dumpster on the surveillance video from a\n\nneighboring trailer, which prompted the officers to search the dumpster. Jacobs\n\ntestified that the contents in the garbage bag recovered from the dumpster included\n\njeans that had a \u201cseeping brown stain,\u201d a soiled pair of women\u2019s underwear that had\n\nbeen torn or cut, and mail belonging to Smothers. He also testified that soiled towels\n\nand L.S.\u2019s cell phone were found in Smothers\u2019 car.\n\n                           Michael Trimpe\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b621} Michael Trimpe, a trace evidence examiner with the Hamilton County\n\nCoroner\u2019s crime laboratory, testified that he determined that the boot prints found at\n\nthe scene matched the boots that Smothers was wearing when he was arrested.\n\n                                 E.M.\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b622} E.M. was the neighbor whose surveillance camera captured the person\n\ndragging what was discovered to be L.S.\u2019s body to the dumpster and walking back and\n\nforth. E.M. testified that in reviewing his surveillance footage, he noticed that his\n\nmaroon truck looked gray due to the infrared lights on the camera.\n\n                         Dr. Karen Looman\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b623} Dr. Karen Looman was a deputy coroner with the Hamilton County\n\nCoroner\u2019s Office when she conducted L.S.\u2019s autopsy. Dr. Looman testified that, while\n\nthe coroner\u2019s office typically conducts an autopsy within 24 hours of receiving a\n\ndecedent\u2019s body, L.S.\u2019s autopsy could not be performed for two days because her body\n\nwas completely frozen after being left outside in the cold.\n\n                              The Autopsy Photographs\n\n\n                                           9\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b624} Dr. Looman testified to the condition of L.S.\u2019s body and identified\n\nphotographs and diagrams of the autopsy, which were introduced into evidence. The\n\nphotographs showed that L.S.\u2019s body was nude when it arrived at the coroner\u2019s office,\n\nhad to be thawed, and reflected injuries that had occurred both before and after death.\n\n       {\u00b625} Defense counsel objected to the photographs at sidebar, arguing that\n\nthey were cumulative and the probative value was not outweighed by prejudice. The\n\ntrial court overruled the objection, stating that the State was putting on evidence\n\nregarding the count for gross abuse of a corpse, and there had been \u201cvery few\n\nphotographs that would be duplicative.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b626} Dr. Looman continued to testify to the injuries found on L.S.\u2019s legs,\n\nheels, and various areas of her face and head. Dr. Looman noted there was dirt on each\n\nheel which was consistent with the body being dragged. Dr. Looman testified that, due\n\nto the injuries on L.S.\u2019s face and hemorrhaging in her eyes, she conducted a forensic\n\nneck dissection to determine whether L.S. had been strangled. Photographs depicting\n\nhemorrhaging of the muscle of L.S.\u2019s throat, thyroid cartilage, and hyoid2 along with\n\ndiagrams of the human throat were introduced as Dr. Looman explained the process\n\nof the forensic neck dissection. The photograph of L.S.\u2019s throat showed trauma and\n\nthat the thyroid cartilage was broken. Autopsy photographs showing the examination\n\nof L.S.\u2019s head and exposure of her skull were introduced to help Dr. Looman explain\n\nthe blunt force trauma that L.S.\u2019s head sustained prior to her death.\n\n       {\u00b627} Dr. Looman testified that the injuries that L.S. sustained showed that\n\nshe died due to asphyxia by strangulation. She explained that a strangling victim tends\n\n\n\n\n2   The hyoid bone is a crescent-shaped bone               at the front of the neck.\nSeehttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hyoid-bone    (accessed Oct. 20, 2025)\n[https://perma.cc/Y58D-8L86].\n\n\n                                            10\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nto struggle with their assailant, including scratching them. Dr. Looman testified there\n\nwere signs that L.S. attempted to fight off her assailant, and that her fingernails were\n\ncut to test for DNA. As discussed in more detail below, Dr. Looman also testified that\n\nshe performed a sexual-assault examination, swabbing different parts of L.S.\u2019s body\n\nand placing those swabs in a \u201csexual-assault kit\u201d before washing the body off.\n\n       {\u00b628} Dr. Looman testified that the coroner\u2019s lab was relocated from Eden\n\nAvenue in Avondale to the city of Blue Ash. Dr. Looman further explained that in\n\npreparation for that move, the untested sexual-assault kit was destroyed. Dr. Looman\n\nadded that she typically would not have the kit destroyed with a homicide case, and no\n\nother evidence in this case was destroyed.\n\n                           Jennifer Dillon\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b629} Jennifer Dillon, a Cincinnati police criminalist, testified to conducting a\n\ncell-phone analysis on Smothers\u2019 and L.S.\u2019s cell phones. She testified that the phone\n\nrecords that she reviewed showed that neither phone was moved from the vicinity of\n\nthe Smotherses trailer overnight, prior to L.S.\u2019s body being discovered.\n\n                        Tracy Sundermeier\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b630} Tracy Sundermeier, a forensic biologist with the Hamilton County crime\n\nlaboratory, recalled conducting DNA testing on swabs from blood found along the drag\n\nmarks in the snow, a purse strap, a black T-shirt, a pair of boots, blue jeans, a black\n\nhooded sweatshirt, towels, swabs labeled to have been taken from Smothers, fingernail\n\nclippings from L.S., and bodily fluids from L.S. and Smothers. She explained that the\n\nblood found in the drag marks and on Smothers\u2019 jeans and boots belonged to L.S., and\n\nthe blood on the black T-shirt belonged to Smothers.\n\n              C. The Hearing on Smothers\u2019 Motion to Dismiss\n\n       {\u00b631} Smothers moved to dismiss the charges against him or, in the\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nalternative, sanction the State\u2019s failure to preserve the untested sexual-assault kit.3 He\n\nargued that R.C. 2933.82 required the State to preserve the swabs for 30 years\n\nfollowing a conviction or as long as the \u201cact\u201d remains unresolved, and, the destruction\n\nof the untested kit warranted dismissal of his charges or \u201cother appropriate sanctions.\u201d\n\n                                Dr. Looman\u2019s Testimony\n\n        {\u00b632} Dr. Looman testified that she conducted the sexual-assault examination\n\nbefore L.S.\u2019s body left the coroner\u2019s office \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d that L.S.\n\ncould have been a victim of sexual homicide as her body was found nude. Dr. Looman\n\nagain testified that the autopsy revealed no signs of sexual assault\u2014particularly, no\n\ninjuries to L.S.\u2019s genitals. She testified that results from the swabs would not have\n\ndetermined whether any sexual contact was consensual. Dr. Looman further testified\n\nthat only L.S.\u2019s and Smothers\u2019 DNA were found on L.S.\u2019s body.\n\n        {\u00b633} Dr. Looman explained that swabs from the kit are stored and would\n\nhave been tested at the request of the police department or the State, but since there\n\nwas no request, the swabs were never tested. Dr. Looman further explained that the\n\ncoroner\u2019s office needed to determine what materials did not need to go to the new\n\nfacility when the office moved.\n\n        {\u00b634} Dr. Looman testified that either the \u201cevidence receiving\u201d or \u201cDNA\u201d\n\ndepartment at the coroner\u2019s office requested that the sexual-assault kit for L.S. be\n\ndestroyed. Dr. Looman explained that she reviewed Smothers\u2019 case and, as it had been\n\npending for nearly three years and she had no indication from the police reports or the\n\nState that sexual assault was alleged, the kit was destroyed in December 2020. Dr.\n\nLooman testified that the kit was the only item that she permitted to be destroyed in\n\n\n\n3 It is not readily apparent from the record whether he made an oral motion or if a clerical error\n\nresulted in the motion not being entered on the docket.\n\n\n                                               12\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nSmothers\u2019 case.\n\n       {\u00b635} While Dr. Looman stated that authorizing the destruction of the kit was\n\na mistake, she also testified that any results from the test would be purely speculative\n\neven if L.S. had engaged in sexual activity prior to her death.\n\n                         Detective Hondorf\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b636} Hondorf testified that he was present during the autopsy, the decision\n\nto conduct a sexual-assault examination was the coroner\u2019s decision, and he had not\n\nasked that the sexual-assault kit be tested for DNA. He added that no one from the\n\npolice department requested that the kit be destroyed.\n\n            The Trial Court Denies Smothers\u2019 Motion to Dismiss\n\n       {\u00b637} Defense counsel argued in closing that the sexual-assault kit was\n\ndestroyed in violation of R.C. 2933.82. Counsel asserted that the coroner failed to\n\nprovide the proper notifications, and the kit would not have been impractical to store.\n\nCounsel initially expressed uncertainty that the evidence would have been exculpatory\n\nbut later stated it would have been exculpatory evidence if it showed that L.S. had\n\nengaged in intercourse with someone other than Smothers prior to her death.\n\n       {\u00b638} The State countered that any evidence derived from testing the kit\n\nwould be purely speculative, and thus, not materially exculpatory but rather\n\npotentially useful. The State added that there was no bad faith on Dr. Looman\u2019s part;\n\nciting Arizona v.

The Trial Continues\n\n                         Detective Hondorf\u2019s Testimony\n\n       {\u00b640} Hondorf testified that L.S.\u2019s blood was found on Smothers\u2019 jeans, left\n\nboot, jacket, and the strap of the purse found in the Smotherses trailer. He further\n\ntestified that there were scratches on Smothers\u2019 face when he was arrested and\n\nSmothers\u2019 DNA was found underneath L.S.\u2019s fingernails. Hondorf recalled\n\nparticipating in the search inside the dumpster that L.S. was found lying near, and that\n\nthe garbage bag matched those found inside of the Smotherses trailer.\n\n       {\u00b641} Hondorf stated that officers had no reason to believe that a sexual\n\nassault took place. He testified that officers investigated R.P.\u2013an alleged paramour of\n\nL.S.\u2013as a potential suspect in L.S.\u2019s death but they found no evidence regarding R.P.\n\n                               Smothers\u2019 Testimony\n\n       {\u00b642} Smothers testified that L.S. scratched his face around 9:30 p.m. on New\n\nYear\u2019s Eve during a disagreement about Smothers\u2019 father having the phone numbers\n\nof the mothers of Smothers\u2019 other children. Smothers asserted that L.S. scratched his\n\nface because he laughed at her after she told his father that, unlike those women, she\n\n\u201cwasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d Smothers testified that L.S. then told him that she was going\n\nto \u201cdrink all the alcohol\u201d and have sex with someone else.\n\n       {\u00b643} Smothers testified that he had fallen asleep at 7:30 p.m., and L.S. was\n\nsitting in the back bedroom of the trailer when he woke up at 9:30 p.m. He stated that\n\nhe asked L.S. to wake him up at 11:30 p.m. and then went back to sleep.\n\n       {\u00b644} Smothers testified that L.S. was supposed to wake him at 5:45 a.m. so\n\nhe could drive her to work, and he had plans to visit his father in Williamstown,\n\nKentucky. Smothers stated that he woke up at 3:00 a.m. and the front door of the\n\ntrailer was \u201cstanding wide open and the heater had been turned off.\u201d He testified that\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nhe assumed that L.S. was in the back bedroom where the curtain was \u201cclosed all the\n\nway\u201d and that L.S. must have left the door open to \u201cfreez[e] [him] out.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b645} Smothers testified that when he did not see L.S. in the back bedroom at\n\n6:30 a.m. he figured she had gone to work. He testified that he saw her cell phone and\n\n\u201cstarted to go through\u201d it. He stated that he saw messages between L.S. and her friend,\n\nand L.S. stated that she was fed up with Smothers passing out and she was planning\n\non leaving to be with another man, so Smothers figured that was where she went.\n\n       {\u00b646} Smothers testified that the person dragging \u201csomething\u201d in the footage\n\nfrom the neighbor\u2019s home-surveillance camera was a different person than shown in\n\nthe State\u2019s four subsequent videos, but it was not him. On cross-examination,\n\nSmothers testified that the person in the video appeared to be wearing a hoody, pants,\n\nand \u201cshoes of some kind\u201d and \u201cdragging\u201d his wife but refuted that they were wearing\n\nthe same clothing as he was when he was arrested because the colors were \u201creversed.\u201d\n\nHe conceded that the footage shows a person carrying a bag in the direction of the\n\ndumpster, and the person looked directly at the camera. He agreed that the drag marks\n\nfound by police came from his trailer but contended that the marks started in the front\n\nyard and L.S. was killed in the \u201cgeneral vicinity\u201d of his trailer versus inside of it. He\n\nasserted that he was asleep at the time the activity that was caught on video occurred.\n\n       {\u00b647} Smothers testified that, by the time the police arrived, he had \u201csmoked\n\na joint\u201d and had three shots of vodka so he wanted to \u201cget away from\u201d them as he had\n\npreviously been arrested while being intoxicated around the police. He testified that\n\nOfficer Bookman was putting up crime-scene tape when he asked if he could leave\n\nbecause he needed to go to work. Smothers stated that he did not tell the police that\n\nhe really was going to visit his father because the police would be more likely to allow\n\nhim to leave if he had to go to work.\n\n\n                                           15\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b648} Smothers testified that he was halfway to his father\u2019s house when he\n\nrealized L.S.\u2019s phone was in his pocket, which was a \u201cforce of habit\u201d because he had\n\ndisconnected his cell phone and only used her phone. He stated that he planned to\n\nreturn to Sharonville to pick L.S. up from work around 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.\n\n       {\u00b649} Smothers testified that he was sitting on his father\u2019s couch when the\n\nGrant County sheriffs called him out of the house and arrested him. He stated that he\n\ndid not know why he was being arrested until he got to the sheriff\u2019s office, and a deputy\n\ntold him there was a felony warrant from \u201canother state\u201d for abuse of a corpse. He\n\ntestified that he discovered that he was arrested for killing L.S. after he was placed in\n\na holding cell. Smothers repeatedly denied killing L.S. during his testimony.\n\n                         The State Refers to Smothers as a Liar\n\n       {\u00b650} While cross-examining Smothers about his infidelity in his marriage\n\nwith L.S., the prosecutor stated that Smothers \u201cquite frankly just cheated in almost\n\nevery relationship that [he] ever had.\u201d The prosecutor asked, \u201cYou have lied over and\n\nover and over to the most important people in your life; is that correct?\u201d and \u201cYou lied\n\nto [the police], hey, I\u2019m going to work?\u201d The prosecutor also stated that Smothers had\n\nlied in his \u201cmost important relationships\u201d to cheat, and, referring to the trial, that he\n\ncould not \u201cthink of a better time to lie . . . .\u201d Smothers did not object to either statement.\n\n     Counsel Asserts that the State Violated Smothers\u2019 Fifth Amendment Rights\n\n       {\u00b651} The following exchange also took place during cross-examination:\n\n       Q. Yesterday, sir, was the first time that anyone heard any of this\n\n       information that you gave us; isn\u2019t that correct?\n\n       A. Other than my lawyers, yes.\n\n       Q. Right. Why didn\u2019t you tell anybody about this stranger that killed\n\n       your wife sir?\n\n\n                                             16\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       A. Because I didn\u2019t know anything about the stranger that killed my wife\n\n       until I got the discovery. I didn\u2019t even know my wife was dead until I got\n\n       arrested.\n\n       Q When you found out she was dead, why didn\u2019t you share any of this\n\n       information?\n\n       A. Because I\u2019m constitutionally protected to only have to speak to my\n\n       attorney.\n\n       Q. Don\u2019t you want to find your wife\u2019s killer, sir?\n\n       A. Absolutely.\n\n       Q. Don\u2019t you think law enforcement\u2019s job is to find [L.S.\u2019] killer, sir?\n\n       A. I do believe it is.\n\n       Q. You want to help, correct?\n\n       A. I would help them if they came to me. Never once did law\n\n       enforcement try and re-interview me.\n\n       Q. They are not allowed to contact you.\n\n       {\u00b652} At sidebar, defense counsel asserted that being asked why he did not tell\n\nlaw enforcement a stranger killed his wife violated Smothers\u2019 right to remain silent\n\nand moved for a mistrial. In response to the State\u2019s argument that Smothers waived\n\nhis right to remain silent by taking the stand, defense counsel argued that Smothers\u2019\n\nright to remain silent upon his arrest is distinguishable from waiving this right by\n\ntestifying in his own defense. The trial court, while cautioning the State in its line of\n\nquestioning, concluded that, by bringing up the new theory that a stranger killed L.S.,\n\nthe State had the right to ask why Smothers did not share this information before.\n\n                          The Jury Finds Smothers Guilty\n\n       {\u00b653} The jury found Smothers guilty on all six counts. The trial court merged\n\n\n                                           17\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nthe second count of murder and the felonious-assault count with the first count of\n\nmurder for sentencing purposes. Smothers was ordered to serve the sentence for\n\nmurder consecutively to the sentence for gross abuse of a corpse and serve the\n\nsentences for both counts of tampering with evidence concurrently with the sentences\n\nin the other counts, for an aggregate sentence of 16-years-to-life imprisonment with a\n\njail-time credit of 1,675 days.\n\n                      E. Smothers\u2019 Motion for a New Trial\n\n       {\u00b654} During the polling of the jury, juror T.L. made a statement to the effect\n\nthat she could see how the infrared feature on her own home-surveillance footage\n\naffects the colors of objects. Smothers filed a motion for a new trial, alleging that T.L.\n\nconducted an experiment that affected the outcome of the trial.\n\n       {\u00b655} The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on Smothers\u2019 motion for a\n\nnew trial based on juror misconduct.\n\n       {\u00b656} During the hearing, T.L. testified that, after deliberations, she had\n\ndiscussed with some jurors that she was looking at camera footage on her cellular\n\nphone from her Ring camera recordings and noticed the colors were different \u201con\n\ninfrared,\u201d which she believed turns on at night. She stated it was not an experiment,\n\nand that she looked at footage from the Ring camera from her phone all the time. T.L.\n\nexplained that she mentioned what she saw on her camera footage while the jurors\n\nwere talking to the attorneys, not while watching the video evidence or during\n\ndeliberations. She denied looking at the cameras just to see if \u201cthey reversed colors.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b657} On cross-examination, T.L. clarified that the jury was waiting to be\n\ncalled back into the courtroom to deliver the verdicts when she mentioned that she\n\nhad noticed that the colors were different in the footage of her cameras. T.L. testified\n\nthat the colors of the camera did not impact her conclusions of Smothers\u2019 guilt, and\n\n\n                                           18\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nthe evidence she considered was Smothers\u2019 possession of L.S.\u2019s cell phone, Smothers\u2019\n\nversion of his wife\u2019s whereabouts, and the evidence found in the garbage bag with\n\nL.S.\u2019s soiled undergarments. She added that she was tasked with going through the\n\nevidence which would point to Smothers\u2019 innocence, but the other evidence showed\n\nthat he was guilty of murder.\n\n       {\u00b658} The other 11 jurors were also questioned during the hearing about T.L.\u2019s\n\ncomments. Three of the other jurors stated that they were unaware of the comments\n\nand all the remaining jurors denied that T.L.\u2019s comments impacted their decision.\n\n       {\u00b659} The trial court found that Smothers was not prejudiced by the juror\n\nmisconduct as all 12 jurors testified that T.L.\u2019s alleged experiment with an infrared\n\ncamera at home did not influence their decisions.\n\n       {\u00b660} This appeal followed.\n\n                                     II.

This\n\nargument is meritless as the bases stated in the affidavit were that L.S. was found\n\ndeceased, Sharonville police had previously been called to Smothers\u2019 residence for a\n\ndomestic dispute, there were reports of \u201cyelling and fighting\u201d coming from the\n\nSmotherses trailer followed by \u201ca loud bang\u201d hours before L.S.\u2019s body was discovered,\n\nthere were drag marks and a trail of blood leading from the dumpster back to the\n\nSmotherses trailer, and Smothers left the scene in his car, which could contain\n\nevidence of L.S.\u2019s murder.\n\n\n                                          20\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b665} Smothers also argues that the affidavit contained a materially false\n\nstatement because it stated that his car was at the Sharonville Police Department when\n\nthe judge signed the warrant while his car was actually in Grant County, Kentucky.

Phone records indicated the neither Smothers\n\nnor L.S.\u2019s phones had been moved from the lot overnight, which is evidence that\n\nneither of them left the trailer while L.S. was still alive and refutes Smothers\u2019\n\nsuggestion that L.S. went to be with R.P. at any point that night.\n\n       {\u00b693} The coroner testified that the antemortem injuries showed that L.S. died\n\nby strangulation after being beaten, and the postmortem marks and tracks in the snow\n\nleading from the Smotherses trailer lot to the dumpster showed that L.S. was dragged\n\n\n                                          30\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nto the dumpster from where the Smotherses lived.

Green, 2024-Ohio-\n\n3260 (1st Dist.), supports his proposition that the destruction of the sexual-assault kit\n\n\n                                            34\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nundermines confidence in Smothers\u2019 murder conviction and creates a reasonable\n\nprobability of acquittal had it been properly disclosed. In Green, this court held that\n\nthe disclosure of the police department\u2019s incident report, which only referenced the\n\nrecorded statement of a witness, did not give sufficient notice because the summary of\n\nthe recording failed to sufficiently apprise the defense that it revealed that the witness\n\nand appellant had work-related issues, which would serve to impeach the witness\u2019\n\ntestimony at trial. Id. at \u00b6 23, 26-29. This court held that the State unlawfully withheld\n\nthe recording where it is required to disclose material evidence in its possession that\n\nis favorable to the defense. Id. at \u00b6 30-31.\n\n       {\u00b6110} Although Smothers filed a request to preserve evidence and requested\n\nthat exculpatory evidence be turned over to him, he has not shown that the results\n\nfrom the untested sexual-assault kit had exculpatory value that was apparent before\n\nthe evidence was destroyed. Smothers\u2019 theory that the untested kit was exculpatory\n\nwas a mere possibility and therefore, not enough to satisfy the standard of\n\nconstitutional materiality. In other words, ascertaining whether L.S. had another\n\nsexual partner has no apparent exculpatory value, and, as Smothers knew this other\n\nalleged sexual partner by name, he could have obtained comparable evidence by other\n\nreasonably available means. Further, the testimonial evidence confirmed that the\n\npolice investigated other potential suspects, but there was no evidence tying any other\n\npersons to the crime.\n\n The Untested Kit Would Have Been Potentially Useful, Not Exculpatory\n\n       {\u00b6111} Dr. Looman testified that it is common for a strangulated victim to fight\n\nwith their assailant, including scratching to fend off the assailant. The only DNA found\n\non L.S.\u2019s body belonged to her and Smothers, and the lab results revealed that only his\n\nDNA was under her fingernails. The testimonial evidence revealed that L.S. struggled\n\n\n                                               35\n\f                 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nwith her assailant, and Smothers had \u201cfresh\u201d scratch marks on his face when he was\n\narrested\u2014the same day L.S.\u2019s body was discovered. As the State argues, and as Dr.\n\nLooman testified, any information from the DNA kit would be speculative; even if DNA\n\nwere found to show she had sexual relations with someone else, Smothers fails to show\n\nhow that would impeach Dr. Looman\u2019s testimony.\n\n       {\u00b6112} The destroyed sexual-assault kit fits the \u201cpotentially useful\u201d category.\n\nDr. Looman testified she only collected samples for the sexual-assault kit as a\n\nprecaution due to the undressed state of the body and because she would not be able\n\nto collect samples once the body left the coroner\u2019s office. The autopsy revealed,\n\nhowever, that L.S. had not been sexually assaulted. Dr. Looman admitted that\n\ndestroying the kit was a \u201cmistake,\u201d which is akin to \u201cbad judgment\u201d or \u201cnegligence.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding statutory requirements or in-house policies governing the\n\nmaintenance of such kits, Dr. Looman testified that she did not know Smothers or L.S.\n\npersonally, the sexual-assault kit was destroyed solely for storage reasons as the office\n\nwas moving to a new location, and she acted unilaterally and did not notify the\n\nprosecutor or the police that she was destroying the kit. Smothers, therefore, failed to\n\nshow the coroner destroyed the sexual-assault kit in bad faith; he provided no evidence\n\nof \u201cdishonest purpose, moral obliquity, conscious wrongdoing, breach of a known duty\n\nthrough some ulterior motive or ill will partaking of the nature of fraud.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6113} The instant case, therefore, is distinguishable from Green. The State did\n\nnot knowingly withhold evidence in its possession that could be favorable to Smothers\u2019\n\ndefense. Whether results of the untested kit would be favorable to Smothers\u2019 defense\n\nis purely speculative. Ultimately, Smothers failed to show that his due-process rights\n\nwere violated by the destruction of potentially-useful evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6114} Smothers\u2019 fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n                                           36\n\f                  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n                        F.

Standifer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2012-Ohio-3132</span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 53 (12th Dist.).\n\n         {\u00b6117} Smothers asserted that the destruction of the sexual-assault kit during\n\nthe pendency of the case was gross negligence and requested that the trial court\n\ninstruct the jury pursuant to Crim.R. 30(A). Smothers asserted that the destruction of\n\nthe kit was intentional, and an adverse instruction could permit the jury to draw an\n\ninference unfavorable to the State, which had control of the evidence.\n\n         {\u00b6118} While addressing Smothers\u2019 proposed jury instruction at sidebar, the\n\ntrial court raised the fact that Smothers\u2019 first two teams of attorneys sought the\n\nstrangulation kit\u2014but not the sexual-assault kit\u2014based on the initial defense theory\n\nthat while Smothers \u201cdid indeed strangle\u201d L.S., it occurred by accident while the couple\n\nwas having sex. The court highlighted that, pursuant to that theory, Smothers sought\n\nexpert testimony based on the strangulation kit and asserted that he was entitled to a\n\nnot-guilty verdict based on his initial defense theory. The court pointed to the fact that\n\n\n                                           37\n\f                   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\nSmothers, however, did not seek a sexual-assault kit, which was available at the time\n\nhe requested the strangulation kit. As the court reiterated, \u201cat no time was the rape kit\n\nzeroed in\u201d between 2018 and 2020 as the trial was pending. The court noted that the\n\ndefense theory changed with the change of counsel, and it \u201crealized [that] theories\n\nchange,\u201d but it could not find malfeasance or gross neglect regarding the destruction\n\nof the sexual-assault kit.4\n\n        {\u00b6119} Here, the State provided a satisfactory explanation for the destruction\n\nof the kit\u2014it was due to the need for storage space where there was no allegation of\n\nsexual assault. There is no dispute that R.C. 2933.82 requires evidence in criminal\n\ncases to be stored until either the case is resolved or 30 years following a conviction,\n\nand the coroner\u2019s policy that the evidence remains stored in case a defendant is\n\ngranted a new trial. The trial court finding, however, that there was no malfeasance or\n\ngross neglect was supported by Dr. Looman\u2019s testimony that the decision was a\n\nmistake and was based on storage purposes versus some malicious intent to affect\n\nSmothers\u2019 defense. Even if the trial court erred by rejecting Smothers\u2019 proposed jury\n\ninstruction, Smothers fails to show how the results of a test of the sexual-assault kit\n\nwould have changed the outcome of the trial. Smothers\u2019 sixth assignment of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                  G. Juror Misconduct\n\n        {\u00b6120} Smothers argues that the trial court abused its discretion by overruling\n\nhis motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct. He asserts that he demonstrated\n\nthat he was presumptively prejudiced by juror misconduct that occurred during\n\ndeliberations and, therefore, was entitled to a new trial.\n\n\n\n4 Of note, the court also denied the State\u2019s request for a flight instruction regarding Smothers\n\ntraveling to his father\u2019s home.\n\n\n                                              38\n\f                OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n       {\u00b6121} When reviewing a motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct, an\n\nappellate court must conduct a two-tier analysis: (1) determine whether there was\n\njuror misconduct and (2) if juror misconduct is found, determine whether it materially\n\naffected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.

(father) appeals from a Family Part judge's order finding\n\nhe abused or neglected his biological daughter, M.Y.S-A. (Mia), born in 2012.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n      Mia was born in Guatemala and lives there with her biological mother.\n\nMia's father, who is a United States citizen, lives in Plainfield, New Jersey. In\n\nDecember 2023, Mia temporarily moved to the United States to live with her\n\nfather so she could apply for a United States passport. Mia planned to stay with\n\nher father for a few weeks and then return to her mother in Guatemala after\n\n                                                                           A-1210-24\n                                       2\n\fobtaining a United States passport. Because Mia's stay was extended for several\n\nmonths rather than a few weeks as planned, her father enrolled Mia as a fifth\n\ngrader in a local public school.\n\n      Also residing in her father's apartment, were her father's former partner\n\n(stepmother), stepmother's biological daughter, A.S. (Ann), and her father and\n\nstepmother's biological son (brother).\n\n      In February 2024, Mia asked Ann to be present so Mia would never be\n\nalone with her father. Because Mia was crying, Ann did not ask why Mia made\n\nthis request.   Thereafter, Ann drove Mia to and from school and her\n\nextracurricular activities. Additionally, Mia started sleeping in Ann's room.\n\n      A few days after Mia requested not to be left alone with her father, Mia\n\ntold Ann about incidents when her father told Mia to remove her pants and\n\nviewed pornography with her. Ann urged Mia to tell someone at school about\n\nthese occurrences.\n\n      Around the same time, Mia also told her swim instructor about the\n\nincidents with her father. An individual at the swimming facility then contacted\n\nthe Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP).\n\n      On February 20, 2024, Mia told her Spanish teacher her father\n\ninappropriately touched her. Mia also told the teacher she did not like her father\n\n\n                                                                            A-1210-24\n                                         3\n\ftouching her and yelled at him to stop. Mia asked her teacher not to tell her\n\nfather she reported the touching incidents.\n\n      Mia's teacher immediately reported Mia's disclosure to the school's social\n\nworker. Mia met with the social worker on February 20, 2024 and explained\n\nshe did not feel safe at home because of her father's behavior. The social worker\n\ncontacted the Plainfield Police Department to report the father's suspected abuse\n\nof Mia. The police transported Mia to a local Child Advocacy Center (CAC).\n\nThe same day, the police arrested Mia's father.\n\n      At the CAC, Detectives Claudia Diaz and Kenneth Mirabella from the\n\nUnion County Prosecutor's Office interviewed Mia. Detective Diaz spoke with\n\nMia in Spanish during the recorded interview. Mia told the detectives about her\n\nfather's abuse. Mia explained her father \"trie[d] to touch [her] . . . like trying to\n\nabuse [her].\" Mia was \"ashamed\" when describing the abuse to the detectives,\n\nfelt \"disgusted to talk about [her]self because of it,\" and \"want[ed] to cry\"\n\nthinking about it.\n\n      Mia told the detectives about one occasion when her father came into her\n\nroom, grabbed her, and she scratched her face on a nail trying to get away. Mia\n\nexplained she escaped by kicking her father.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              A-1210-24\n                                         4\n\f      In another incident from late December 2023, Mia told the detectives that\n\nher father abused her after she showered. Mia reported her father grabbed her\n\nhands, climbed onto her feet so she could not move, and licked her vagina.\n\nFather's conduct on that occasion caused Mia to cry loud enough for the family's\n\ndog to bark. Upon hearing the dog bark, Mia said her father stopped his abuse.\n\nMia explained she then dressed in pajamas and walked out of the house with the\n\ndog to \"get away from\" her father.\n\n      After Mia left the apartment, her stepmother arrived. According to Mia,\n\nher stepmother's arrival made her father \"scared\" and \"kind of nervous\" because\n\nhe did not expect the stepmother to be home at that time.\n\n      Mia also told Detective Diaz that her father licked her vagina the day\n\nbefore their interview. According to Mia, no one was in the apartment at the\n\ntime. Mia explained she was asleep in her room when her father entered. Mia\n\nsaid her father pulled down her pants and licked her vagina \"about three times.\"\n\nMia told the detective she kicked her father, pulled up her pants, and ran out of\n\nthe house.\n\n      Mia described for Detective Diaz other instances of her father's abuse.\n\nOne time, when Ann and her stepmother left the apartment, her father told her\n\nto \"[h]urry up before they come, pull down your pants.\" Mia said something\n\n\n                                                                           A-1210-24\n                                       5\n\fsimilar happened the same morning as the interview. According to Mia, her\n\nfather stated \"'[p]lease let's do it.    [Ann] is asleep, [and the brother, and\n\nstepmother] went to work.'\" Mia understood her father wanted to have sex.\n\nWhen Detective Diaz asked if Mia understood the term \"sex,\" Mia responded:\n\n\"[T]hey used to say in the school in Guatemala where I studied, that when a\n\nwoman and a man take their clothes off . . . [a]nd the man . . . puts his part inside\n\nthe woman's part.\" Mia said her father did not have sex with her.\n\n      Mia also told the detectives that her father showed her pornography on his\n\ncellphone. Mia explained pornography was \"when people have sex . . . [b]ut it\n\nis recorded.\" Mia recalled her father showing her pornography and saying he\n\nwanted her to \"do this,\" which she understood as him wanting to have sex with\n\nher. While watching pornography, Mia claimed her father said, \"[t]his girl is\n\nyour age, she does it with her daddy and you don't want to do it. I buy you the\n\nthings you want, and you never do me the favor.\"\n\n      Mia also reported to the detective she had her own room but slept in Ann's\n\nroom so her father would not abuse her. When Mia began sleeping in Ann's\n\nroom, Mia said her father \"started getting furious, angry.\"\n\n      The same day as the detectives' interview, Mia underwent a sexual abuse\n\nexamination at a local hospital. The examination revealed blood and male DNA\n\n\n                                                                               A-1210-24\n                                         6\n\fon Mia's underwear. Detective Mirabelli later testified the blood and DNA were\n\nnot matched to any specific individual. Nor did the police confirm whether the\n\nDNA came from semen.\n\n      Detective Mirabelli interviewed Ann and Mia's stepmother. Ann reported\n\nshe \"noticed that [Mia's father] would call [her and stepmother] whenever they\n\nleft the home to try to get a time when they would return,\" which never occurred\n\nbefore Mia lived with the family. Mia's father refused to be interviewed by\n\nDetective Mirabelli.\n\n      Detective Mirabelli obtained a search warrant for the apartment and\n\nconfiscated the father's cell phone. The detective observed a nail in the molding\n\naround the door to Mia's room.\n\n      In March 2024, the DCPP arranged to return Mia to her mother in\n\nGuatemala. While at the airport, Mia told a DCPP worker about two additional\n\nincidents of abuse by her father when he visited in Guatemala. Mia said her\n\nfather took her to a field to teach her to drive a car. After her father parked the\n\ncar, he spoke to Mia about puberty and asked her to remove her pants to see if\n\nshe had pubic hair. Despite her father's insistence, Mia did not remove her pants.\n\nDuring another incident in Guatemala, after Mia's mother left the house, her\n\nfather took a shower. When her father got out of the shower, he asked Mia to\n\n\n                                                                             A-1210-24\n                                        7\n\fbring him clothes. Mia's father exposed himself to her. The DCPP worker\n\ntestified Mia was soft-spoken and embarrassed when discussing these incidents.\n\n      Between August and October 2024, the Family Part judge held fact-\n\nfinding hearings on the DCPP's abuse or neglect allegations against Mia's father.\n\nDuring those hearings, the judge heard testimony from Detectives Diaz and\n\nMirabelli, Mia's Spanish teacher, the DCPP worker who took Mia to the airport,\n\nand Ann. The judge found these witnesses to be credible. Because she returned\n\nto Guatemala, Mia did not testify. However, Mia's recorded interview with\n\nDetective Diaz was admitted in evidence\n\n      Based on Mia's recorded interview and the testimony of the trial\n\nwitnesses, the judge found the DCPP established Mia's father abused or\n\nneglected Mia contrary to N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(3).\n\n      On appeal, Mia's father argues Mia's out-of-court statements were not\n\ncorroborated by independently admissible evidence as required under N.J.S.A.\n\n9:6-8.46(a)(4). Additionally, Mia's father asserts the Family Part judge's abuse\n\nor neglect determination impermissibly relied on incompetent evidence never\n\noffered or admitted during the fact-finding hearing. Specifically, he claims the\n\nstatements regarding pornography on his cellphone constituted impermissible\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-1210-24\n                                       8\n\fhearsay, the DNA evidence presented at trial was never matched to him, and the\n\njudge failed to identify the basis for Mia's precocious knowledge.\n\n      Our scope of review is limited.

N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(3) defines an \"[a]bused or neglected child\" as \"a\n\n\n                                                                             A-1210-24\n                                        9\n\fchild less than [eighteen] years of age whose parent or guardian . . . commits or\n\nallows to be committed an act of sexual abuse against the child.\" A finding of\n\nsexual abuse must be based on a \"preponderance of the evidence.\" N.J.S.A. 9:6-\n\n8.46(b). Under N.J.A.C. 3A:10-7.4(a)(2), a finding of substantiated sexual\n\nabuse includes \"[s]ubjecting a child to sexual activity or exposure to\n\ninappropriate sexual activity or materials.\"\n\n      Defendant contends there was no corroborating evidence supporting Mia's\n\nreported sexual abuse.       We review a judge's determination concerning\n\ncorroborating evidence under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.46(a)(4) de novo. N.J. Div. of\n\nChild Prot. & Permanency v. A.D., 455 N.J.

Under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.46(a)(4), \"previous\n\nstatements made by the child relating to any allegations of abuse or neglect shall\n\nbe admissible in evidence; provided, however, that no such statement, if\n\nuncorroborated, shall be sufficient to make a fact finding of abuse or neglect.\"\n\nSee also N.J.

New Jersey courts have found:\n\n            In most cases of child sexual abuse . . . there is no direct\n            physical or testimonial evidence. The child victim\n            is often the only eyewitness to the crime, and physical\n            corroboration is rare because the sex offenses\n            committed against children tend to be nonviolent\n            offenses such as petting, exhibitionism, fondling and\n            oral copulation. Physical corroboration may also be\n            unavailable because most children do not resist, either\n            out of ignorance or out of respect for authority.\n            Consequently, in order to give any real effect to the\n            child victim hearsay statute, the corroboration\n            requirement must reasonably be held to include indirect\n            evidence of abuse.\n\n            [N.J. Div. of Youth & Fam. Servs. v. Z.P.R., 351 N.J.\n            Super. 427, 436 (App. Div. 2002) (quoting State v.\n            Swan, 790 P.2d 610, 615-16 (Wash. 1990)).]\n\n      The corroboration requirement may be satisfied by indirect evidence, such\n\nas \"a child victim's precocious knowledge of sexual activity, a semen stain on a\n\nchild's blanket, a child's nightmares and psychological evidence.\" N.J. Div. of\n\nChild Prot. & Permanency v. I.B., 441 N.J. Super. 585, 591 (App. Div. 2015)\n\n(quoting Z.P.R., 351 N.J. Super. at 436). In Z.P.R., we found \"no doubt that\n\n\n                                                                           A-1210-24\n                                       11\n\fevidence of age-inappropriate sexual behavior could provide the necessary\n\ncorroboration required by N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.46(a)(4).\" 351 N.J. Super. at 436.\n\nSimilarly, a child's \"knowledge of sexual practices beyond her reasonably\n\nanticipated imagination\" may corroborate the child's reported sexual abuse.\n\nIbid. (quoting State v. D.R., 214 N.J. Super. 278, 298 (App. Div. 1986)).\n\n      Having reviewed the record, we are satisfied the judge properly found\n\ncorroborating evidence to support Mia's hearsay statements regarding her\n\nfather's abuse. The judge concluded the testimony of Detectives Diaz and\n\nMirabelli, Mia's Spanish teacher, the DCPP's caseworker, and Ann, as well as\n\nthe physical evidence from the apartment, provided corroborating evidence of\n\nabuse and neglect beyond Mia's out-of-court statements. The judge did not rely\n\nsolely on Mia's hearsay statements as the basis for his finding abuse or neglect.\n\nSee P.W.R., 205 N.J. at 33.\n\n      Specifically, the judge found Mia's \"precocious knowledge\" of sexual\n\nactivity, described by way of the \"idiosyncratic details contained in her\n\nstatements\" to the various witnesses sufficiently corroborated the abuse or\n\nneglect allegations. Additionally, the judge determined Mia's revealing to Ann\n\nshe did not want to be left alone with her father, Ann then driving Mia to and\n\nfrom school and other activities, and Ann allowing Mia to sleep in her bedroom\n\n\n                                                                            A-1210-24\n                                      12\n\ffurther corroborated the allegations.       The judge found Ann's testimony\n\ndescribing her personal observation of Mia's behavioral changes also\n\ncorroborated the abuse or neglect allegation.\n\n      The judge noted Mia gave Detective Diaz a detailed description of both\n\nthe pornography her father forced her to watch and her father's performing of\n\noral sex on her. Mia's description of these sexual activities was far too detailed\n\nto be imagined or age appropriate.\n\n      Moreover, the judge relied on Detective Mirabelli's testimony regarding\n\nthe physical evidence supporting Mia's allegations. This included the detective\n\nstating he found a nail protruding from the molding in the door frame to Mia's\n\nroom and Mia telling the Detective Diaz she suffered a facial scratch from a nail\n\nwhen she fled from her father's abuse. Detective Mirabelli also testified about\n\nthe blood and male DNA evidence found on Mia's underwear from the hospital's\n\nsexual assault examination. The judge determined \"all of this information,\n\nstanding alone\" constituted \"sufficient indirect evidence to corroborate [Mia's]\n\nclaim of abuse.\"\n\n      The judge concluded \"each of the[] witnesses corroborated different parts\n\nof [Mia]'s entire story.\" The judge determined the testimony and physical\n\nevidence \"collectively established\" Mia's father abused or neglected her. The\n\n\n                                                                            A-1210-24\n                                       13\n\frecord contains ample evidence to corroborate Mia's extensive and detailed\n\nallegations regarding her father's sexual abuse. We agree with the judge's\n\nfinding there was sufficient corroborating evidence in the record to support\n\nMia's out-of-court hearsay statements regarding her father's abuse or neglect.\n\n      To the extent we have not addressed any of Mia's father's remaining\n\narguments, they lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion.\n\nR. 2:11-3(e)(1)(E).\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-1210-24\n                                      14\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                      RECORD IMPOUNDED\n\n                                 NOT FOR PUBLICATION WITHOUT THE\n                                APPROVAL OF THE APPELLATE DIVISION\n        This opinion shall not &quot;constitute precedent or be binding upon any court .&quot; Although it is posted on the\n     internet, this opinion is binding only on the parties in the case and its use in other cases is limited .

(father) appeals from a Family Part judge&#x27;s order finding\n\nhe abused or neglected his biological daughter, M.Y.S-A. (Mia), born in 2012.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n      Mia was born in Guatemala and lives there with her biological mother.\n\nMia&#x27;s father, who is a United States citizen, lives in Plainfield, New Jersey. In\n\nDecember 2023, Mia temporarily moved to the United States to live with her\n\nfather so she could apply for a United States passport. Mia planned to stay with\n\nher father for a few weeks and then return to her mother in Guatemala after\n\n                                                                           A-1210-24\n                                       2\n\fobtaining a United States passport. Because Mia&#x27;s stay was extended for several\n\nmonths rather than a few weeks as planned, her father enrolled Mia as a fifth\n\ngrader in a local public school.\n\n      Also residing in her father&#x27;s apartment, were her father&#x27;s former partner\n\n(stepmother), stepmother&#x27;s biological daughter, A.S. (Ann), and her father and\n\nstepmother&#x27;s biological son (brother).\n\n      In February 2024, Mia asked Ann to be present so Mia would never be\n\nalone with her father. Because Mia was crying, Ann did not ask why Mia made\n\nthis request.   Thereafter, Ann drove Mia to and from school and her\n\nextracurricular activities. Additionally, Mia started sleeping in Ann&#x27;s room.\n\n      A few days after Mia requested not to be left alone with her father, Mia\n\ntold Ann about incidents when her father told Mia to remove her pants and\n\nviewed pornography with her. Ann urged Mia to tell someone at school about\n\nthese occurrences.\n\n      Around the same time, Mia also told her swim instructor about the\n\nincidents with her father. An individual at the swimming facility then contacted\n\nthe Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP).\n\n      On February 20, 2024, Mia told her Spanish teacher her father\n\ninappropriately touched her. Mia also told the teacher she did not like her father\n\n\n                                                                            A-1210-24\n                                         3\n\ftouching her and yelled at him to stop. Mia asked her teacher not to tell her\n\nfather she reported the touching incidents.\n\n      Mia&#x27;s teacher immediately reported Mia&#x27;s disclosure to the school&#x27;s social\n\nworker. Mia met with the social worker on February 20, 2024 and explained\n\nshe did not feel safe at home because of her father&#x27;s behavior. The social worker\n\ncontacted the Plainfield Police Department to report the father&#x27;s suspected abuse\n\nof Mia. The police transported Mia to a local Child Advocacy Center (CAC).\n\nThe same day, the police arrested Mia&#x27;s father.\n\n      At the CAC, Detectives Claudia Diaz and Kenneth Mirabella from the\n\nUnion County Prosecutor&#x27;s Office interviewed Mia. Detective Diaz spoke with\n\nMia in Spanish during the recorded interview. Mia told the detectives about her\n\nfather&#x27;s abuse. Mia explained her father &quot;trie[d] to touch [her] . . . like trying to\n\nabuse [her].&quot; Mia was &quot;ashamed&quot; when describing the abuse to the detectives,\n\nfelt &quot;disgusted to talk about [her]self because of it,&quot; and &quot;want[ed] to cry&quot;\n\nthinking about it.\n\n      Mia told the detectives about one occasion when her father came into her\n\nroom, grabbed her, and she scratched her face on a nail trying to get away. Mia\n\nexplained she escaped by kicking her father.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              A-1210-24\n                                         4\n\f      In another incident from late December 2023, Mia told the detectives that\n\nher father abused her after she showered. Mia reported her father grabbed her\n\nhands, climbed onto her feet so she could not move, and licked her vagina.\n\nFather&#x27;s conduct on that occasion caused Mia to cry loud enough for the family&#x27;s\n\ndog to bark. Upon hearing the dog bark, Mia said her father stopped his abuse.\n\nMia explained she then dressed in pajamas and walked out of the house with the\n\ndog to &quot;get away from&quot; her father.\n\n      After Mia left the apartment, her stepmother arrived. According to Mia,\n\nher stepmother&#x27;s arrival made her father &quot;scared&quot; and &quot;kind of nervous&quot; because\n\nhe did not expect the stepmother to be home at that time.\n\n      Mia also told Detective Diaz that her father licked her vagina the day\n\nbefore their interview. According to Mia, no one was in the apartment at the\n\ntime. Mia explained she was asleep in her room when her father entered. Mia\n\nsaid her father pulled down her pants and licked her vagina &quot;about three times.&quot;\n\nMia told the detective she kicked her father, pulled up her pants, and ran out of\n\nthe house.\n\n      Mia described for Detective Diaz other instances of her father&#x27;s abuse.\n\nOne time, when Ann and her stepmother left the apartment, her father told her\n\nto &quot;[h]urry up before they come, pull down your pants.&quot; Mia said something\n\n\n                                                                           A-1210-24\n                                       5\n\fsimilar happened the same morning as the interview. According to Mia, her\n\nfather stated &quot;&#x27;[p]lease let&#x27;s do it.    [Ann] is asleep, [and the brother, and\n\nstepmother] went to work.&#x27;&quot; Mia understood her father wanted to have sex.\n\nWhen Detective Diaz asked if Mia understood the term &quot;sex,&quot; Mia responded:\n\n&quot;[T]hey used to say in the school in Guatemala where I studied, that when a\n\nwoman and a man take their clothes off . . . [a]nd the man . . . puts his part inside\n\nthe woman&#x27;s part.&quot; Mia said her father did not have sex with her.\n\n      Mia also told the detectives that her father showed her pornography on his\n\ncellphone. Mia explained pornography was &quot;when people have sex . . . [b]ut it\n\nis recorded.&quot; Mia recalled her father showing her pornography and saying he\n\nwanted her to &quot;do this,&quot; which she understood as him wanting to have sex with\n\nher. While watching pornography, Mia claimed her father said, &quot;[t]his girl is\n\nyour age, she does it with her daddy and you don&#x27;t want to do it. I buy you the\n\nthings you want, and you never do me the favor.&quot;\n\n      Mia also reported to the detective she had her own room but slept in Ann&#x27;s\n\nroom so her father would not abuse her. When Mia began sleeping in Ann&#x27;s\n\nroom, Mia said her father &quot;started getting furious, angry.&quot;\n\n      The same day as the detectives&#x27; interview, Mia underwent a sexual abuse\n\nexamination at a local hospital. The examination revealed blood and male DNA\n\n\n                                                                               A-1210-24\n                                         6\n\fon Mia&#x27;s underwear. Detective Mirabelli later testified the blood and DNA were\n\nnot matched to any specific individual. Nor did the police confirm whether the\n\nDNA came from semen.\n\n      Detective Mirabelli interviewed Ann and Mia&#x27;s stepmother. Ann reported\n\nshe &quot;noticed that [Mia&#x27;s father] would call [her and stepmother] whenever they\n\nleft the home to try to get a time when they would return,&quot; which never occurred\n\nbefore Mia lived with the family. Mia&#x27;s father refused to be interviewed by\n\nDetective Mirabelli.\n\n      Detective Mirabelli obtained a search warrant for the apartment and\n\nconfiscated the father&#x27;s cell phone. The detective observed a nail in the molding\n\naround the door to Mia&#x27;s room.\n\n      In March 2024, the DCPP arranged to return Mia to her mother in\n\nGuatemala. While at the airport, Mia told a DCPP worker about two additional\n\nincidents of abuse by her father when he visited in Guatemala. Mia said her\n\nfather took her to a field to teach her to drive a car. After her father parked the\n\ncar, he spoke to Mia about puberty and asked her to remove her pants to see if\n\nshe had pubic hair. Despite her father&#x27;s insistence, Mia did not remove her pants.\n\nDuring another incident in Guatemala, after Mia&#x27;s mother left the house, her\n\nfather took a shower. When her father got out of the shower, he asked Mia to\n\n\n                                                                             A-1210-24\n                                        7\n\fbring him clothes. Mia&#x27;s father exposed himself to her. The DCPP worker\n\ntestified Mia was soft-spoken and embarrassed when discussing these incidents.\n\n      Between August and October 2024, the Family Part judge held fact-\n\nfinding hearings on the DCPP&#x27;s abuse or neglect allegations against Mia&#x27;s father.\n\nDuring those hearings, the judge heard testimony from Detectives Diaz and\n\nMirabelli, Mia&#x27;s Spanish teacher, the DCPP worker who took Mia to the airport,\n\nand Ann. The judge found these witnesses to be credible. Because she returned\n\nto Guatemala, Mia did not testify. However, Mia&#x27;s recorded interview with\n\nDetective Diaz was admitted in evidence\n\n      Based on Mia&#x27;s recorded interview and the testimony of the trial\n\nwitnesses, the judge found the DCPP established Mia&#x27;s father abused or\n\nneglected Mia contrary to N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(3).\n\n      On appeal, Mia&#x27;s father argues Mia&#x27;s out-of-court statements were not\n\ncorroborated by independently admissible evidence as required under N.J.S.A.\n\n9:6-8.46(a)(4). Additionally, Mia&#x27;s father asserts the Family Part judge&#x27;s abuse\n\nor neglect determination impermissibly relied on incompetent evidence never\n\noffered or admitted during the fact-finding hearing. Specifically, he claims the\n\nstatements regarding pornography on his cellphone constituted impermissible\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-1210-24\n                                       8\n\fhearsay, the DNA evidence presented at trial was never matched to him, and the\n\njudge failed to identify the basis for Mia&#x27;s precocious knowledge.\n\n      Our scope of review is limited.

New Jersey courts have found:\n\n            In most cases of child sexual abuse . . . there is no direct\n            physical or testimonial evidence. The child victim\n            is often the only eyewitness to the crime, and physical\n            corroboration is rare because the sex offenses\n            committed against children tend to be nonviolent\n            offenses such as petting, exhibitionism, fondling and\n            oral copulation. Physical corroboration may also be\n            unavailable because most children do not resist, either\n            out of ignorance or out of respect for authority.\n            Consequently, in order to give any real effect to the\n            child victim hearsay statute, the corroboration\n            requirement must reasonably be held to include indirect\n            evidence of abuse.\n\n            [N.J.

Additionally, the judge determined Mia&#x27;s revealing to Ann\n\nshe did not want to be left alone with her father, Ann then driving Mia to and\n\nfrom school and other activities, and Ann allowing Mia to sleep in her bedroom\n\n\n                                                                            A-1210-24\n                                      12\n\ffurther corroborated the allegations.       The judge found Ann&#x27;s testimony\n\ndescribing her personal observation of Mia&#x27;s behavioral changes also\n\ncorroborated the abuse or neglect allegation.\n\n      The judge noted Mia gave Detective Diaz a detailed description of both\n\nthe pornography her father forced her to watch and her father&#x27;s performing of\n\noral sex on her. Mia&#x27;s description of these sexual activities was far too detailed\n\nto be imagined or age appropriate.\n\n      Moreover, the judge relied on Detective Mirabelli&#x27;s testimony regarding\n\nthe physical evidence supporting Mia&#x27;s allegations. This included the detective\n\nstating he found a nail protruding from the molding in the door frame to Mia&#x27;s\n\nroom and Mia telling the Detective Diaz she suffered a facial scratch from a nail\n\nwhen she fled from her father&#x27;s abuse. Detective Mirabelli also testified about\n\nthe blood and male DNA evidence found on Mia&#x27;s underwear from the hospital&#x27;s\n\nsexual assault examination.

Shadle, Deputy Attorney General, argued\n                   the cause for respondent (Matthew J. Platkin, Attorney\n                   General, attorney; Sookie Bae-Park, Assistant Attorney\n                   General, of counsel; Charles A. Shadle, on the brief).\n\fPER CURIAM\n\n      Frank Bright appeals an April 24, 2024 final agency decision of the\n\nDepartment of Community Affairs (\"DCA\"), which upheld a Notice of Statutory\n\nViolation and Order to Pay Penalty issued by the Bureau of Housing Inspection\n\n(\"Bureau\"). We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n      The subject property is a multiple dwelling property located on George\n\nStreet in New Brunswick and is registered by Bright with the Bureau under the\n\nHotel and Multiple Dwelling Law (\"HMDL\"), N.J.S.A. 55:13A-1 to -31.\n\n      On July 19, 2019, the Bureau inspected the property and issued an\n\nInspection Report and Orders of the Commissioner, citing nineteen violations.\n\nHowever, no fines were issued. This report advised Bright that a reinspection\n\nwould take place after sixty days and that he could request an extension of time\n\nto abate or contest the violations. He did not contest the report or seek an\n\nextension.\n\n      When the Bureau reinspected the property on November 10, 2022, it\n\ndetermined that, of the nineteen violations previously cited, eight violations\n\nremained unabated, five violations were undetermined, and six had been abated.\n\nConsequently, the Bureau issued a Commissioner's Notice of Statutory\n\n\n                                                                          A-3108-23\n                                       2\n\fViolation and Order to Pay Penalty of $525.           Bright promptly filed an\n\nadministrative appeal and the matter was transferred to the Office of\n\nAdministrative Law for a hearing by an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\").\n\n      The hearing commenced in August 2023. The Bureau provided testimony\n\nfrom Inspector Sean Daly and Senior Inspector Neil Costanzo. Bright cross-\n\nexamined these witnesses but chose not to testify himself or to present other\n\nwitnesses.   The Bureau submitted several exhibits, including photographs\n\ndocumenting the violations; Bright offered a single exhibit\u2014an April 2023\n\nemail with attachments.\n\n      The ALJ found the Bureau's witnesses to be credible and determined the\n\neight violations remained unabated as of November 2022. The ALJ concluded\n\nthere were no mitigating or aggravating circumstances and found the penalties\n\nassessed by the Bureau complied with N.J.A.C. 5:10-1.17. The ALJ affirmed\n\nthe $525 penalty and ordered that Bright abate the interior violations within\n\nthirty-days and the exterior violations within sixty-days of the decision.\n\n      Bright submitted exceptions to the ALJ's initial decision. On April 24,\n\nDCA issued its final agency decision adopting the ALJ's findings. This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-3108-23\n                                        3\n\f                                      II.\n\n      We begin our analysis by acknowledging the legal principles that govern\n\nthis appeal. Our review of an agency's final decision is limited. Hayes v. Bd.\n\nof Trs., Police & Firemen's Ret. Sys., 421 N.J. Super. 43, 51 (App. Div. 2011).\n\nOur function is to review \"agency decisions under an arbitrary and capricious\n\nstandard.\" Zimmerman v. Sussex Cnty. Educ. Servs. Com'n, 237 N.J. 465, 475\n\n(2019). We will uphold an agency's determination \"'unless there is a clear\n\nshowing that it is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, or that it lacks fair\n\nsupport in the record.'\" Saccone v. Bd. of Trs., Police & Firemen's Ret. Sys.,\n\n219 N.J. 369, 380 (2014) (quoting Russo v. Bd. of Trs., Police & Firemen's Ret.\n\nSys., 206 N.J. 14, 27 (2011)). In determining whether the agency's decision is\n\narbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, we must examine:\n\n            (1) whether the agency's decision offends the State or\n            Federal Constitution;\n            (2) whether the agency's action violates express or\n            implied legislative policies;\n            (3) whether the record contains substantial evidence to\n            support the findings on which the agency based its\n            action; and\n            (4) whether in applying the legislative policies to the\n            facts, the agency clearly erred in reaching a conclusion\n            that could not reasonably have been made on a showing\n            of the relevant factors.\n\n\n                                                                          A-3108-23\n                                       4\n\f            [In re Taylor, 158 N.J. 644, 656 (1999) (quoting Brady\n            v. Bd. of Rev., 152 N.J. 197, 210-11 (1997)).]\n\n      We examine whether the findings of the agency could have been reached\n\non the credible evidence in the record, considering the proofs as a whole. Close\n\nv. Kordulak Bros., 44 N.J. 589, 598-99 (1965). \"The burden of demonstrating\n\nthat the agency's action was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable rests upon the\n\n[party] challenging the administrative action.\" In re Arenas, 385 N.J. Super.\n\n440, 443-44 (App. Div. 2006) (citing McGowan v. N.J. State Parole Bd., 347\n\nN.J. Super. 544, 563 (App. Div. 2002)). In reviewing an agency's decision, we\n\n\"must be mindful of, and deferential to, the agency's 'expertise and superior\n\nknowledge of a particular field[,]'\" Circus Liquors, Inc. v. Governing Body of\n\nMiddletown Twp., 199 N.J. 1, 10 (2009) (quoting Greenwood v. State Police\n\nTraining Ctr., 127 N.J. 500, 513 (1992)), and \"'may not substitute [our] own\n\njudgment for the agency's,'\" In re Stallworth, 208 N.J. 182, 194 (2011) (quoting\n\nIn re Carter, 191 N.J. 474, 483 (2007)). We defer to an agency's interpretation\n\nof its own regulations and applicable statutes. In re M.M., 463 N.J. Super. 128,\n\n137-38 (App. Div. 2020).\n\n                                      III.\n\n      Before considering petitioner's substantive arguments, it is important to\n\nreview the HMDL. The purpose of the HMDL is to \"protect[ ] . . . the health\n\n                                                                           A-3108-23\n                                       5\n\fand welfare of the residents of this State in order to assure the provision therefor\n\nof decent, standard and safe units of dwelling space.\" N.J.S.A. 55:13A-2. In\n\nenacting the HMDL, the Legislature intended to provide \"stronger and more\n\ndetailed measures . . . for the protection of tenants.\" Trentacost v. Brussel, 82\n\nN.J. 214, 230 (1980). The HMDL is liberally construed and grants broad\n\nauthority to the Department to regulate hotels and multiple dwellings throughout\n\nNew Jersey. Rothman v. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs, 226 N.J. Super. 229, 231-32\n\n(App. Div. 1988) (citing N.J.S.A. 55:13A-2).\n\n      The HMDL expressly grants to the Department's Commissioner \"all the\n\npowers necessary and appropriate to carry out and execute the purposes of [the\n\nHMDL].\" N.J.S.A. 55:13A-6. Those powers include the Department's authority\n\nto protect occupants of hotels and multiple dwellings with respect to the\n\nissuance, suspension, or revocation of HMDL licenses. Ibid.; see also N.J.A.C.\n\n5:10-1B.1. To achieve those goals, the HMDL empowers the Department to\n\npromulgate regulations \"deem[ed] necessary to assure that any hotel or multiple\n\ndwelling will be maintained in such manner as is consistent with, and will\n\nprotect, the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants or intended occupants\n\nthereof, or of the public generally.\" N.J.S.A. 55:13A-7. Further, DCA Bureau\n\ninspectors are authorized to \"enter upon and examine and inspect at all\n\n\n                                                                              A-3108-23\n                                         6\n\freasonable times any building, enclosure, or premises, or any part thereof . . .\n\nfor the purpose of determining compliance with\" the HMDL and its\n\nimplementing regulations.    N.J.A.C. 5:10-1.10(a); see also N.J.S.A. 55:13A-\n\n6(b) (authorizing the DCA \"[t]o enter and inspect, without prior notice, any hotel\n\nor multiple dwelling . . . and to make such investigation as is reasonably\n\nnecessary\"). The Department's Commissioner has the power to carry out the\n\npurposes of the HMDL pertaining to assessing penalties. In particular, under\n\nN.J.S.A. 55:13A-6(g), the Department's Commissioner may \"assess penalties\n\nand to compromise and settle any claim for a penalty for any violation . . . in\n\nsuch amount in the discretion of the commissioner as may appear appropriate\n\nand equitable under all of the circumstances of said violation.\"\n\n                                       IV.\n\n      On appeal, petitioner's main contention is that, for a variety of reasons, he\n\nwas not afforded due process. We are not persuaded.\n\n      The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that a\n\nState may not \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due\n\nprocess of law.\" U.S. Const., amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. The concept of \"procedural due\n\nprocess\" places \"constraints on governmental decisions which deprive\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-3108-23\n                                        7\n\findividuals of 'liberty' or 'property' interests within the meaning of\" this clause.\n\nMathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976).\n\n      The United States Supreme Court has held that \"some form of hearing is\n\nrequired before an individual is finally deprived of a property interest.\" Id. at\n\n333. \"The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard\n\n'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.'\" Ibid. (quoting Armstrong\n\nv. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965)). However, beyond this basic obligation,\n\n\"due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the\n\nparticular situation demands.\" Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972).\n\n\"[N]ot all situations calling for procedural safeguards call for the same kind of\n\nprocedure.\" Ibid.\n\n      First, Bright asserts material witnesses who conducted inspections and\n\nhad direct knowledge of the alleged violations were not produced at trial,\n\ndepriving him of the opportunity to confront and cross-examine them. He also\n\nobjects to the lack of photographic evidence for some of the violations. These\n\narguments are without merit.       The Bureau had the burden of proving the\n\nviolations by a preponderance of the evidence. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Land,\n\n186 N.J. 163, 169 (2006). How it meets its evidentiary burden is properly left\n\nto the Bureau's discretion. Bright's due process rights were not violated by how\n\n\n                                                                              A-3108-23\n                                         8\n\fthe Bureau's decided to present its case. Moreover, Bright had the opportunity\n\nto call any witness or present any photographs that he deemed necessary to rebut\n\nthe Bureau's proofs.\n\n      Next, Bright argues that Inspector Daly was never on location despite his\n\ntestimony that he inspected the property on November 10, 2022. We must \"give\n\ndue regard to [an] agency's credibility findings.\" Ardan v. Bd. of Rev., 444 N.J.\n\nSuper. 576, 584 (App. Div. 2016); see also Parsells v. Bd. of Educ. of Borough\n\nof Somerville, Somerset County, 254 N.J. 152, 159 (2023). We will \"not disturb\n\nthe factual findings . . . unless we are convinced that they are so manifestly\n\nunsupported by[,] or inconsistent with[,] the competent, relevant[,] and\n\nreasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice.\" D'Agostino\n\nv. Maldonado, 216 N.J. 168, 182 (2013) (fourth alteration in original) (quoting\n\nSeidman v. Clifton Sav. Bank, S.L.A., 205 N.J. 150, 169 (2011)). Additionally,\n\nwe defer to credibility determinations because the judge \"'hears the case, sees\n\nand observes the witnesses, and hears them testify,' affording [the judge] 'a\n\nbetter perspective than a reviewing court in evaluating the veracity of a\n\nwitness.'\" Gnall v. Gnall, 222 N.J. 414, 428 (2015) (quoting Cesare v. Cesare,\n\n154 N.J. 394, 412 (1998)). The ALJ determined that Daly was a credible witness\n\nand was present at the inspection. The ALJ's determination is supported by\n\n\n                                                                           A-3108-23\n                                       9\n\fsufficient evidence in the record.\n\n      We next address Bright's contention that it was improper for Costanzo\n\nto visit the Property weeks before trial to take photographs and to familiarize\n\nhimself with the case in anticipation of his hearing testimony. Here, no\n\nadditional violations were issued as a result of Costanzo's visit. Moreover,\n\nBright's claim that the photographs taken were \"being used to backdate\n\nalleged violations from years prior\" is belied by the record.\n\n      With respect to Bright's contention regarding discovery, we see no\n\nimpropriety by DCA having provided \"packets of information\" to the ALJ\n\nprior to the hearing. Nor are we persuaded that petitioner is entitled to a new\n\nhearing or other relief on the grounds that discovery was not provided to him\n\nin a timely manner. Bright waived these assertions when discussing DCA's\n\nexhibits; the ALJ asked him, \"do you have any objection to any of these\n\n[e]xhibits?\" Bright answered, \"[n]o, no [be]cause it actually worked out in\n\nmy favor.\" As such, we see no reason for our intervention.\n\n      Bright also contends that the ALJ improperly conducted a private\n\ninvestigation to determine who owned the property. The New Brunswick Tax\n\nAssessors Office was the source of the information concerning ownership of the\n\nProperty.   Under N.J.A.C. 1:1-15.2(a), an ALJ may take official notice of\n\n\n                                                                            A-3108-23\n                                       10\n\fjudicially noticeable facts consistent with N.J.R.E. 201. N.J.R.E. 201(b)(3)\n\nprovides that a court may judicially notice \"specific facts and propositions of\n\ngeneralized knowledge which are capable of immediate determination by resort\n\nto sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" We are satisfied\n\nthat the information kept by the Tax Assessor's Office was reliable. Moreover,\n\nBright admitted the property was his in the April 2023 emails that he admitted\n\ninto evidence.    In one of those emails Bright told Daly that he was \"not\n\nwelcomed not invited to enter my property at 218 George Street, New\n\nBrunswick, New Jersey 08901.\"\n\n      Bright also contends the ALJ violated his Fifth Amendment rights by\n\ncompelling him, a self-represented litigant, to testify in order to enter documents\n\ninto the record. The Fifth Amendment provides in pertinent part, \"[n]o person\n\nshall be . . . compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against [themselves].\"\n\nU.S. Const. amend. V. Under New Jersey law, the privilege is codified at\n\nN.J.S.A. 2A:84A-19. That privilege extends to administrative proceedings,\n\nN.J.A.C. 1:1-15.4; see State, Dep't of Law & Pub. Safety, Div. of Gaming Enf't\n\nv. Merlino, 216 N.J. Super. 579, 587 (App. Div. 1987). However, \"[p]rotection\n\nagainst self-incrimination 'applies only when the accused is compelled to make\n\na testimonial communication that is incriminating.'\" Borough of Franklin v.\n\n\n                                                                              A-3108-23\n                                        11\n\fSmith, 466 N.J. Super. 487, 499 (App. Div. 2021) (quoting Fisher v. United\n\nStates, 425 U.S. 391, 408 (1976)). N.J.R.E. 502 makes clear, moreover, that a\n\n\"matter will not be held to incriminate if it clearly appears that the witness has\n\nno reasonable cause to apprehend criminal prosecution.\"\n\n      Nothing in the administrative matter before us suggests that Bright\n\nreasonably apprehended that his answer would expose him to criminal\n\nprosecution. And in any event, the record shows, despite Bright's contention,\n\nthe ALJ did not compel him to answer, considering that when he refused, the\n\nALJ simply proceeded with the hearing. Consequently, there was no violation\n\nof Bright's right against self-incrimination.\n\n      Finally, we only briefly address Bright's contention that the ALJ erred by\n\nnot sequestering the witnesses. Bright's reliance on N.J.R.E. 615 is misplaced.\n\nThat rule states, \"[a]t the request of a party or on the court's own motion, the\n\ncourt may, in accordance with law, enter an order sequestering the witnesses.\"\n\nN.J.R.E. 615. Our review of the record shows that Bright never requested that\n\nwitnesses be sequestered. In any event, N.J.A.C. 1:1-15.1(c) makes clear that\n\n\"[p]arties in contested cases shall not be bound by statutory or common law rules\n\nof evidence or any formally adopted in the New Jersey Rules except as\n\nspecifically provided in these rules.\" Under N.J.A.C. 1:1-15.8, witnesses are\n\n\n                                                                            A-3108-23\n                                       12\n\fnot required to be sequestered.\n\n      After a thorough review of the record, we are satisfied the final agency\n\ndecision is supported by credible evidence, and the assessment of penalties was\n\nlawful and appropriate. Any remaining arguments raised by petitioner do not\n\nrequire further discussion, as they lack sufficient merit.

Shadle, Deputy Attorney General, argued\n                   the cause for respondent (Matthew J. Platkin, Attorney\n                   General, attorney; Sookie Bae-Park, Assistant Attorney\n                   General, of counsel; Charles A. Shadle, on the brief).\n\fPER CURIAM\n\n      Frank Bright appeals an April 24, 2024 final agency decision of the\n\nDepartment of Community Affairs (&quot;DCA&quot;), which upheld a Notice of Statutory\n\nViolation and Order to Pay Penalty issued by the Bureau of Housing Inspection\n\n(&quot;Bureau&quot;). We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n      The subject property is a multiple dwelling property located on George\n\nStreet in New Brunswick and is registered by Bright with the Bureau under the\n\nHotel and Multiple Dwelling Law (&quot;HMDL&quot;), N.J.S.A. 55:13A-1 to -31.\n\n      On July 19, 2019, the Bureau inspected the property and issued an\n\nInspection Report and Orders of the Commissioner, citing nineteen violations.\n\nHowever, no fines were issued. This report advised Bright that a reinspection\n\nwould take place after sixty days and that he could request an extension of time\n\nto abate or contest the violations. He did not contest the report or seek an\n\nextension.\n\n      When the Bureau reinspected the property on November 10, 2022, it\n\ndetermined that, of the nineteen violations previously cited, eight violations\n\nremained unabated, five violations were undetermined, and six had been abated.\n\nConsequently, the Bureau issued a Commissioner&#x27;s Notice of Statutory\n\n\n                                                                          A-3108-23\n                                       2\n\fViolation and Order to Pay Penalty of $525.           Bright promptly filed an\n\nadministrative appeal and the matter was transferred to the Office of\n\nAdministrative Law for a hearing by an Administrative Law Judge (&quot;ALJ&quot;).\n\n      The hearing commenced in August 2023. The Bureau provided testimony\n\nfrom Inspector Sean Daly and Senior Inspector Neil Costanzo. Bright cross-\n\nexamined these witnesses but chose not to testify himself or to present other\n\nwitnesses.   The Bureau submitted several exhibits, including photographs\n\ndocumenting the violations; Bright offered a single exhibit\u2014an April 2023\n\nemail with attachments.\n\n      The ALJ found the Bureau&#x27;s witnesses to be credible and determined the\n\neight violations remained unabated as of November 2022. The ALJ concluded\n\nthere were no mitigating or aggravating circumstances and found the penalties\n\nassessed by the Bureau complied with N.J.A.C. 5:10-1.17. The ALJ affirmed\n\nthe $525 penalty and ordered that Bright abate the interior violations within\n\nthirty-days and the exterior violations within sixty-days of the decision.\n\n      Bright submitted exceptions to the ALJ&#x27;s initial decision. On April 24,\n\nDCA issued its final agency decision adopting the ALJ&#x27;s findings. This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-3108-23\n                                        3\n\f                                      II.\n\n      We begin our analysis by acknowledging the legal principles that govern\n\nthis appeal.

The ALJ&#x27;s determination is supported by\n\n\n                                                                           A-3108-23\n                                       9\n\fsufficient evidence in the record.\n\n      We next address Bright&#x27;s contention that it was improper for Costanzo\n\nto visit the Property weeks before trial to take photographs and to familiarize\n\nhimself with the case in anticipation of his hearing testimony. Here, no\n\nadditional violations were issued as a result of Costanzo&#x27;s visit. Moreover,\n\nBright&#x27;s claim that the photographs taken were &quot;being used to backdate\n\nalleged violations from years prior&quot; is belied by the record.\n\n      With respect to Bright&#x27;s contention regarding discovery, we see no\n\nimpropriety by DCA having provided &quot;packets of information&quot; to the ALJ\n\nprior to the hearing. Nor are we persuaded that petitioner is entitled to a new\n\nhearing or other relief on the grounds that discovery was not provided to him\n\nin a timely manner. Bright waived these assertions when discussing DCA&#x27;s\n\nexhibits; the ALJ asked him, &quot;do you have any objection to any of these\n\n[e]xhibits?&quot; Bright answered, &quot;[n]o, no [be]cause it actually worked out in\n\nmy favor.&quot; As such, we see no reason for our intervention.\n\n      Bright also contends that the ALJ improperly conducted a private\n\ninvestigation to determine who owned the property. The New Brunswick Tax\n\nAssessors Office was the source of the information concerning ownership of the\n\nProperty.   Under N.J.A.C. 1:1-15.2(a), an ALJ may take official notice of\n\n\n                                                                            A-3108-23\n                                       10\n\fjudicially noticeable facts consistent with N.J.R.E. 201. N.J.R.E. 201(b)(3)\n\nprovides that a court may judicially notice &quot;specific facts and propositions of\n\ngeneralized knowledge which are capable of immediate determination by resort\n\nto sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.&quot; We are satisfied\n\nthat the information kept by the Tax Assessor&#x27;s Office was reliable. Moreover,\n\nBright admitted the property was his in the April 2023 emails that he admitted\n\ninto evidence.    In one of those emails Bright told Daly that he was &quot;not\n\nwelcomed not invited to enter my property at 218 George Street, New\n\nBrunswick, New Jersey 08901.&quot;\n\n      Bright also contends the ALJ violated his Fifth Amendment rights by\n\ncompelling him, a self-represented litigant, to testify in order to enter documents\n\ninto the record. The Fifth Amendment provides in pertinent part, &quot;[n]o person\n\nshall be . . . compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against [themselves].&quot;\n\nU.S. Const. amend. V.

N.J.R.E. 502 makes clear, moreover, that a\n\n&quot;matter will not be held to incriminate if it clearly appears that the witness has\n\nno reasonable cause to apprehend criminal prosecution.&quot;\n\n      Nothing in the administrative matter before us suggests that Bright\n\nreasonably apprehended that his answer would expose him to criminal\n\nprosecution. And in any event, the record shows, despite Bright&#x27;s contention,\n\nthe ALJ did not compel him to answer, considering that when he refused, the\n\nALJ simply proceeded with the hearing. Consequently, there was no violation\n\nof Bright&#x27;s right against self-incrimination.\n\n      Finally, we only briefly address Bright&#x27;s contention that the ALJ erred by\n\nnot sequestering the witnesses. Bright&#x27;s reliance on N.J.R.E. 615 is misplaced.\n\nThat rule states, &quot;[a]t the request of a party or on the court&#x27;s own motion, the\n\ncourt may, in accordance with law, enter an order sequestering the witnesses.&quot;\n\nN.J.R.E. 615. Our review of the record shows that Bright never requested that\n\nwitnesses be sequestered. In any event, N.J.A.C. 1:1-15.1(c) makes clear that\n\n&quot;[p]arties in contested cases shall not be bound by statutory or common law rules\n\nof evidence or any formally adopted in the New Jersey Rules except as\n\nspecifically provided in these rules.&quot; Under N.J.A.C. 1:1-15.8, witnesses are\n\n\n                                                                            A-3108-23\n                                       12\n\fnot required to be sequestered.\n\n      After a thorough review of the record, we are satisfied the final agency\n\ndecision is supported by credible evidence, and the assessment of penalties was\n\nlawful and appropriate.

Lynch,\n            on the brief).\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n      In this collection action, defendants Dry Clean Express No. 1, LLC\n\n(\"DCE-1\") and its principal, Matsamy Vasquez,1 appeal from a September 27,\n\n2024 amended judgment entered in favor of plaintiff Green Lago, LLC (\"Green\n\nLago\"), awarding jointly and severally $1,625,900.68, plus attorney's fees of\n\n$21,132.50, for a total of $1,647,033.18, with post-judgment interest of 18% per\n\nannum. DCE-1 and Vasquez dispute the validity the original judgment entered\n\nin 2015, claiming lack of service of the complaint and further contend the court's\n\ngrant of 18% per annum interest as opposed to interest under Rule 4:42-11(a)\n\nwas in error. We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  In the instant appeal DCE-1 and Vasquez are the sole defendants-appellants.\nIn this opinion, however, consistent with the underlying briefs, we refer to DCE-\n1, Vasquez, Marroquin, and Any Garment Cleaners No. 3 (\"AGC-3\") as\n\"defendants,\" except where we refer to Carlos Marroquin individually.\n                                                                            A-0360-24\n                                        2\n\f                                        I.\n\n      This matter has an extensive prior history dating from the 2015 filing of\n\nplaintiff's complaint and various subsequent orders enforcing litigant's rights as\n\ndefendants failed to satisfy the court ordered levy. We, however, limit our\n\nrecitation of the facts and discussion to those pertinent to our determination of\n\nthe issues raised before us.\n\n      In November 2013, Green Lago sold two dry-cleaning businesses to Any\n\nGarment Cleaners No. 3, LLC (\"AGC-3\") for approximately $465,573. AGC-3\n\nexecuted a promissory note in favor of Green Lago for this purchase price, which\n\nwas personally guaranteed by AGC-3's managing member, Carlos Marroquin.\n\nIt is undisputed that neither AGC-3 nor Marroquin made any of the monthly\n\npayments under the note. Green Lago sued for breach of the promissory note\n\nand obtained a default judgment against both AGC-3 and Marroquin in the\n\namount of $542,258.61 on January 9, 2015. This 2015 judgment was never\n\namended until 2024.\n\n      Following the entry of default judgment, Green Lago learned that\n\nMarroquin had transferred ownership of one of the dry-cleaning businesses to\n\nhis brother, Vasquez, and his wholly-owned company DCE-1. Green Lago also\n\nuncovered a \"Consulting Agreement\" executed on January 5, 2015, days prior\n\n\n                                                                            A-0360-24\n                                        3\n\fto the entry of default against AGC-3, in which Vasquez and DCE-1 agreed to\n\npay Marroquin $1,325,000 for the dry-cleaning business to be paid in 36\n\ninstallments of $7,930.05, with an additional \"balloon\" payment of $1,075,650\n\nat the end of the 36 months. Vasquez, through DCE-1, made some payments to\n\nMarroquin but as of early 2018, over $1 million remained outstanding and\n\nneither DCE-1 nor Vasquez made any further payments.\n\n      Green Lago subsequently moved in the Law Division for a writ of\n\nexecution against the proceeds Vasquez and DCE-1 had agreed to pay to\n\nMarroquin directly pursuant to the Consulting Agreement. 2 In January 2019,\n\nwhen Vasquez and DCE-1 did not fully comply, Green Lago moved for an order\n\nin aid of litigant's rights and for the turnover of funds under N.J.S.A. 2A:17-63.3\n\nDefendants did not admit the debt and Marroquin opposed plaintiff's motion and\n\ncross-moved seeking to vacate the default judgment, stay enforcement\n\n\n\n2\n  The writ of execution acted as a levy on \"[a]ny and all rights, credits, monies\n[and] effects in [his] hands due or to become due to [AGC] and [] Marroquin.\"\n3\n  \"After a levy upon a debt due or accruing to the judgment debtor from a third\nperson, herein called the garnishee, the court may upon notice to the garnishee\nand the judgment debtor, and if the garnishee admits the debt, direct the debt, to\nan amount not exceeding the sum sufficient to satisfy the execution, to be paid\nto the officer holding the execution or to the receiver appointed by the court,\neither in 1 payment or in installments as the court may deem just.\" N.J.S.A.\n2A:17-63.\n                                                                             A-0360-24\n                                        4\n\fproceedings, and consolidate the instant matter with a pending related lawsuit\n\nplaintiffs had filed against defendants Marroquin, AGC-3, Vaquez, and DCE-\n\n1.4\n\n      The court granted plaintiff's motion and ordered defendants to turn over\n\nmonthly payments due under the Consulting Agreement to the Sheriff in an\n\nAugust 2019 order. In that same order, the court denied defendant Marroquin's\n\nmotion to vacate the default judgment based on his assertions he was never\n\nserved with the 2015 complaint and the default judgment should therefore be\n\nvoided.   The court concluded Marroquin had in fact been served with the\n\ncomplaint as evidenced by service of the complaint and summons, Marroquin's\n\nawareness of this action, and confirmation by Marroquin's attorney. Marroquin\n\ndid not appeal this May 2019 decision.\n\n      Approximately one year later, when defendants failed to remit the\n\npayments due, plaintiff moved for the first of three orders to enforce litigant's\n\nrights and for interest in the amount of 18% pursuant to the express terms in the\n\n\n\n4\n  In this action, plaintiff alleged that Marroquin fraudulently transferred Union\nCounty dry cleaning businesses to Vasquez and companies he owned for less\nthan fair market value and with the intent to place plaintiff's assets beyond reach,\nin violation of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"UFTA\"), codified under\nN.J.S.A. 25:2-20 et seq. The UFTA provides remedies for creditors where\ndebtors have fraudulently transferred assets to avoid collection.\n                                                                              A-0360-24\n                                         5\n\fConsulting Agreement. The court granted plaintiff's motion over defendants'\n\nobjection and again ordered defendants to make monthly payment to the Sheriff\n\nin accordance with the Consulting Agreement until the debt was paid.\n\n      On September 10, 2021, Marroquin filed for bankruptcy protection under\n\nChapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and subsequently obtained an order\n\ndischarging his debts. This order discharged Marroquin of personal liability\n\nover debts owed and explained that creditors \"cannot collect discharged debts,\"\n\nbut that a creditor with a lien may enforce a claim against the debtors' property\n\nsubject to that lien.\n\n      In the following January, plaintiff again sought to enforce the court's prior\n\norders directing defendants to turnover funds and for 18% interest, which was\n\ngranted on April 12, 2024. In that order, the court added Vasquez and DCE-1\n\nand set the amount of the judgment at $1,625,900.68, inclusive of interest of\n\n18% per annum.\n\n      Approximately six months later, plaintiff filed its final motion in aid of\n\nlitigant's rights, seeking a final judgment of $1,625,900.68 plus 18% interest.\n\nThe court granted plaintiff's motion in its entirety, awarding attorney's fees and\n\npost-judgment interest at 18% pursuant to the express terms of the parties'\n\nConsulting Agreement, and entered a final judgment on September 13, 2024.\n\n\n                                                                             A-0360-24\n                                        6\n\fThe court explained that although fee-shifting provisions are generally\n\ndisfavored, New Jersey law allowed the parties to contract for attorney 's fees,\n\nprovided the fees are reasonable. The court agreed the contractual interest rate\n\nwas expressly permitted based on the underlying agreement, and that the lower\n\nstatutory interest rate set forth under Rule 4:42-11(a) would not control. On\n\nSeptember 27, 2024, the court entered an amended judgment solely against\n\ndefendants DCE-1 and Vasquez in the amount of $1,625,900.68, plus\n\n$21,132.50 in attorney's fees.\n\n      This appeal followed.\n\n                                      II.\n\n      The trial court's factual findings \"are binding on appeal when supported\n\nby adequate, substantial, credible evidence.\" Seidman v.

The trial court\u2019s determination regarding\n\nenforcement of litigant\u2019s rights pursuant to Rule 1:10-3 is reviewed on appeal\n\nfor abuse of discretion. Savage v. Tp. of Neptune, 472 N.J. Super. 291, 313\n\n(App. Div. 2022); Wear, 455 N.J. Super. at 458-59.\n\n                                        A.\n\n      Before us, DCE-1 and Vasquez argue the court erred in granting the 2015\n\ndefault judgment against AGC-3 and Marroquin and as a result, the judgment\n\nand subsequent writ of attachment must be vacated. They maintain \"[a]ll of\n\n[p]laintiff's requested relief against defendants in this case center around a writ\n\nof execution issued against [them] based upon the default judgment entered\n\nagainst [d]efendant Carlos Marroquin,\" and \"service of process was defective\n\nand the judgment was void.\"\n\n      A default judgment is considered void if rendered in the face of defective\n\npersonal service. Rosa v. Araujo, 260 N.J. Super. 458, 462 (App. Div. 1992).\n\n\n                                                                             A-0360-24\n                                        8\n\fHowever, affidavits of service are presumed correct and may be rebutted only\n\nby clear and convincing evidence. See Jameson v. Great Atl. and Pac. Tea Co.,\n\n363 N.J. Super. 419, 426 (App. Div. 2003). Additionally, despite conflicting\n\nclaims, defendants bear the burden to defeat the presumption of validity of\n\nservice beyond bare assertions. Id. at 427. Even if a court finds technical defects\n\nin service, a judgment may not be considered void if the defendant had actual\n\nnotice of the action. Citibank, N.A. v. Russo, 334 N.J. Super. 346, 352 (App.\n\nDiv. 2000).\n\n      Applying the requisite deferential standard, we reject appellants'\n\ncontention the default judgment entered in 2015 was \"defective\" and must be\n\nvoided.    Reviewing this same argument, the court properly considered\n\ndefendants' 2019 post-judgment action in response to plaintiff's complaint and\n\nfound no basis to void the default judgment. As the court stated:\n\n              Mr. Marroquin admits receiving the complaint and\n              knew a default was going to be entered. He did not\n              deny hiring an attorney to attempt to negotiate a\n              settlement for himself and AGC-3. Under these\n              circumstances the court will not vacate the judgment.\n              The rules with regard to service are designed to [ensure]\n              parties receive notice. He has admitted he has received\n              notice.\n\nWe also note that plaintiff's supplemental certification made as part of this\n\nrecord shows that shortly after service of the complaint, Marroquin's counsel\n\n                                                                             A-0360-24\n                                         9\n\fcommunicated with plaintiff's counsel regarding a possible settlement, which is\n\nindicative of Marroquin's knowledge of the complaint. Thus, appellants cannot\n\nestablish a lack of actual notice of the action.\n\n      Moreover, the extensive record before us makes clear the parties have\n\nengaged in lengthy post-judgment litigation spanning approximately ten years,\n\nincluding multiple motions by plaintiff seeking to compel defendants to satisfy\n\nthe judgment entered against them. Against this backdrop, we are hard-pressed\n\nto conclude the court erred in its 2019 denial of defendants' application for\n\nvacatur of the 2015 default judgment. Rather, we agree with the court that\n\ndefendants asserted no basis to void the default judgment.\n\n                                         B.\n\n      Appellants next contend they were denied due process because they were\n\nadded to the action as judgment debtors only at the post-judgment enforcement\n\nstage, preventing them from taking discovery or presenting defenses . They\n\nmaintain that as non-parties to the initial lawsuit, they did not admit any debt\n\ndue under the Consulting Agreement as required by N.J.S.A. 2A:17-63. The\n\nstatute provides that after a levy upon a debt due to the judgment debtor from a\n\nthird party, the court may, upon notice and opportunity to contest, direct\n\npayment to the creditor if the court finds, based on the evidence and any\n\n\n                                                                          A-0360-24\n                                        10\n\fresponse from the garnishee, that a debt is in fact due. It does not require an\n\nexpress admission of liability by the garnishee.\n\n      Applying the plain language of the statute, we are unpersuaded by\n\nappellants' argument the turnover order was improper absent their admission of\n\nindebtedness. This argument is without merit and constitutes a misreading of\n\nthe statute. The statute is intended to authorize enforcement after a levy and\n\ncourt determination of a debt is due, following notice and opportunity to contest.\n\n      Here, the court considered Vasquez's own testimony regarding the\n\nConsulting Agreement, payment records, and supporting documentation, and\n\nfound the debt owed to Marroquin under the Consulting Agreement was valid\n\nand subject to levy and turnover to Green Lago. Marroquin had notice of the\n\npost-judgment enforcement proceeding and participated in the subsequent\n\nmotion practice and neither Marroquin nor Vasquez appealed any court orders\n\nuntil the entry of the September 2024 amended final judgment.                 The\n\nrequirements of due process in post-judgment proceedings are more limited than\n\nat the merits stage: due process is satisfied if the nonparties, here DCE-1 and\n\nVasquez, receive reasonable notice and a meaningful opportunity to oppose\n\nexecution or contest their liability before funds are turned over or judgments are\n\nenforced. See First Resol. Inv. Corp. v. Seker, 171 N.J. 502, 515 (2002) (citing\n\n\n                                                                            A-0360-24\n                                       11\n\fMullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950))\n\n(explaining that post-judgment due process requires only notice and an\n\nopportunity to be heard before property is taken or a judgment is enforced).\n\n      We further note the court added Vasquez and DCE-1 as direct judgment\n\ndebtors, as opposed to mere garnishees, after AGC-3 and Marroquin failed to\n\ncomply with multiple turnover orders. We observe no error on the part of the\n\ncourt given the persistent withholding of funds from plaintiff.\n\n      Additionally, the record shows that following the entry of default\n\njudgment, Green Lago served Vasquez and DCE-1 with all relevant writs,\n\nmotions, and court orders, prompting Vasquez and DCE-1 to appear, submit\n\nwritten opposition, file certifications, and participate in motion hearings, thus\n\navailing themselves of all procedural and due process safeguards.\n\n                                       C.\n\n      We next turn to appellants' challenge to the turnover orders, as well as the\n\ncalculation of both the amount due and post-judgment interest. They argue the\n\ncourt exceeded its authority in determining the scope of the turnover orders and\n\nthe amount to be paid, and that any recovery by plaintiff was limited to sums\n\nactually accrued under the Consulting Agreement with Marroquin. They further\n\nmaintain that because Marroquin had been discharged in bankruptcy, plaintiff\n\n\n                                                                            A-0360-24\n                                      12\n\fcould not collect beyond what was independently due from Vasquez or DCE -1,\n\nand the court\u2019s orders impermissibly extended the reach of enforcement beyond\n\nthose limits. We are unpersuaded.\n\n      Appellants' challenge to the court's grant of 18% per annum post-judgment\n\ninterest, in which they argue the court was constrained to apply the Rule 4:42-\n\n11(a) rate, is equally unavailing. 5 The court properly applied the contractual\n\nrate of 18% as set forth in the promissory note. Pursuant to basic breach of\n\ncontract principles, the promissory note provided for 18% interest and\n\ndefendants failed to demonstrate that 18% was unconscionable or contrary to\n\npublic policy. See Metlife Cap. Fin. Corp. v. Washington Ave. Assocs. L.P.,\n\n159 N.J. 484, 494, 498-99, 504 (1999); State Bank v. Rinaldi, 303 N.J. Super.\n\n239, 265 (App. Div. 1997). Accordingly, we reject appellants' assertion the\n\ncourt abused its discretion by applying the express contract rate.\n\n      We further reject appellants' assertion the bankruptcy discharge order\n\nprecludes any recovery against them and that the continuing enforcement by\n\nplaintiff violates the automatic stay provision. Their argument is without merit\n\nas it is contrary to the express language of the discharge order. That order\n\n\n\n5\n  Rule 4:42-11(a) addresses the calculation of simple interest on awards, orders,\nor judgments.\n                                                                           A-0360-24\n                                      13\n\fexplicitly states \"a discharge removes the debtors' personal liability for debts\n\nowed before the debtors' bankruptcy case was filed.\" (emphasis added).\n\n      Here, Marroquin filed his bankruptcy petition in the United States\n\nBankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas on September 10, 2021, and\n\nthe discharge order relieved him of his personal liability for debts owed prior to\n\nthe petition being filed. However, as to defendants Vasquez and DCE-1, they\n\nare not the beneficiaries of this discharge. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(e) (\"[D]ischarge\n\nof a debt of the debtor does not affect the liability of any other entity on, or the\n\nproperty of any other entity for, such debt\").       Thus, the discharge did not\n\neliminate the underlying obligation owed by Vasquez and DCE-1 pursuant to\n\nthe court\u2019s prior turnover orders, nor did it affect Green Lago\u2019s right to continue\n\nenforcing its judgment as to the levied property and assets.\n\n                                        D.\n\n      Lastly, we are equally unpersuaded by appellants' remaining arguments\n\ncontending the entire controversy doctrine applies and the court erred by failing\n\nto consolidate this post-judgment enforcement action with the previously\n\npending, now dismissed, lawsuit against Marroquin. The entire controversy\n\ndoctrine \"generally requires parties to an action to raise all transactionally\n\nrelated claims in that same action.\" Largoza v. FKM Real Est. Holdings, Inc.,\n\n\n                                                                              A-0360-24\n                                        14\n\f474 N.J.

Super. 59, 67 (App. Div. 2020)).\n\n      Here, however, the post-judgment proceedings were confined to the\n\nenforcement and satisfaction of a previously-adjudicated debt and did not\n\naddress the merits of plaintiff's claims because defendants failed to respond to\n\nthe complaint. Under these circumstances, we do not countenance defendants'\n\nbelated attempts to resurrect a long-settled matter based on the entire\n\ncontroversy doctrine. We further note this issue was not raised below and we\n\ndecline to address its merits here. Alan J. Cornblatt, P.A. v. Barow, 153 N.J.\n\n218, 230 (1998) (citing State v.

DCE-1 and Vasquez dispute the validity the original judgment entered\n\nin 2015, claiming lack of service of the complaint and further contend the court&#x27;s\n\ngrant of 18% per annum interest as opposed to interest under Rule 4:42-11(a)\n\nwas in error. We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  In the instant appeal DCE-1 and Vasquez are the sole defendants-appellants.\nIn this opinion, however, consistent with the underlying briefs, we refer to DCE-\n1, Vasquez, Marroquin, and Any Garment Cleaners No. 3 (&quot;AGC-3&quot;) as\n&quot;defendants,&quot; except where we refer to Carlos Marroquin individually.\n                                                                            A-0360-24\n                                        2\n\f                                        I.\n\n      This matter has an extensive prior history dating from the 2015 filing of\n\nplaintiff&#x27;s complaint and various subsequent orders enforcing litigant&#x27;s rights as\n\ndefendants failed to satisfy the court ordered levy. We, however, limit our\n\nrecitation of the facts and discussion to those pertinent to our determination of\n\nthe issues raised before us.\n\n      In November 2013, Green Lago sold two dry-cleaning businesses to Any\n\nGarment Cleaners No. 3, LLC (&quot;AGC-3&quot;) for approximately $465,573. AGC-3\n\nexecuted a promissory note in favor of Green Lago for this purchase price, which\n\nwas personally guaranteed by AGC-3&#x27;s managing member, Carlos Marroquin.\n\nIt is undisputed that neither AGC-3 nor Marroquin made any of the monthly\n\npayments under the note. Green Lago sued for breach of the promissory note\n\nand obtained a default judgment against both AGC-3 and Marroquin in the\n\namount of $542,258.61 on January 9, 2015. This 2015 judgment was never\n\namended until 2024.\n\n      Following the entry of default judgment, Green Lago learned that\n\nMarroquin had transferred ownership of one of the dry-cleaning businesses to\n\nhis brother, Vasquez, and his wholly-owned company DCE-1. Green Lago also\n\nuncovered a &quot;Consulting Agreement&quot; executed on January 5, 2015, days prior\n\n\n                                                                            A-0360-24\n                                        3\n\fto the entry of default against AGC-3, in which Vasquez and DCE-1 agreed to\n\npay Marroquin $1,325,000 for the dry-cleaning business to be paid in 36\n\ninstallments of $7,930.05, with an additional &quot;balloon&quot; payment of $1,075,650\n\nat the end of the 36 months. Vasquez, through DCE-1, made some payments to\n\nMarroquin but as of early 2018, over $1 million remained outstanding and\n\nneither DCE-1 nor Vasquez made any further payments.\n\n      Green Lago subsequently moved in the Law Division for a writ of\n\nexecution against the proceeds Vasquez and DCE-1 had agreed to pay to\n\nMarroquin directly pursuant to the Consulting Agreement. 2 In January 2019,\n\nwhen Vasquez and DCE-1 did not fully comply, Green Lago moved for an order\n\nin aid of litigant&#x27;s rights and for the turnover of funds under N.J.S.A. 2A:17-63.3\n\nDefendants did not admit the debt and Marroquin opposed plaintiff&#x27;s motion and\n\ncross-moved seeking to vacate the default judgment, stay enforcement\n\n\n\n2\n  The writ of execution acted as a levy on &quot;[a]ny and all rights, credits, monies\n[and] effects in [his] hands due or to become due to [AGC] and [] Marroquin.&quot;\n3\n  &quot;After a levy upon a debt due or accruing to the judgment debtor from a third\nperson, herein called the garnishee, the court may upon notice to the garnishee\nand the judgment debtor, and if the garnishee admits the debt, direct the debt, to\nan amount not exceeding the sum sufficient to satisfy the execution, to be paid\nto the officer holding the execution or to the receiver appointed by the court,\neither in 1 payment or in installments as the court may deem just.&quot; N.J.S.A.\n2A:17-63.\n                                                                             A-0360-24\n                                        4\n\fproceedings, and consolidate the instant matter with a pending related lawsuit\n\nplaintiffs had filed against defendants Marroquin, AGC-3, Vaquez, and DCE-\n\n1.4\n\n      The court granted plaintiff&#x27;s motion and ordered defendants to turn over\n\nmonthly payments due under the Consulting Agreement to the Sheriff in an\n\nAugust 2019 order. In that same order, the court denied defendant Marroquin&#x27;s\n\nmotion to vacate the default judgment based on his assertions he was never\n\nserved with the 2015 complaint and the default judgment should therefore be\n\nvoided.   The court concluded Marroquin had in fact been served with the\n\ncomplaint as evidenced by service of the complaint and summons, Marroquin&#x27;s\n\nawareness of this action, and confirmation by Marroquin&#x27;s attorney. Marroquin\n\ndid not appeal this May 2019 decision.\n\n      Approximately one year later, when defendants failed to remit the\n\npayments due, plaintiff moved for the first of three orders to enforce litigant&#x27;s\n\nrights and for interest in the amount of 18% pursuant to the express terms in the\n\n\n\n4\n  In this action, plaintiff alleged that Marroquin fraudulently transferred Union\nCounty dry cleaning businesses to Vasquez and companies he owned for less\nthan fair market value and with the intent to place plaintiff&#x27;s assets beyond reach,\nin violation of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (&quot;UFTA&quot;), codified under\nN.J.S.A. 25:2-20 et seq. The UFTA provides remedies for creditors where\ndebtors have fraudulently transferred assets to avoid collection.\n                                                                              A-0360-24\n                                         5\n\fConsulting Agreement. The court granted plaintiff&#x27;s motion over defendants&#x27;\n\nobjection and again ordered defendants to make monthly payment to the Sheriff\n\nin accordance with the Consulting Agreement until the debt was paid.\n\n      On September 10, 2021, Marroquin filed for bankruptcy protection under\n\nChapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and subsequently obtained an order\n\ndischarging his debts. This order discharged Marroquin of personal liability\n\nover debts owed and explained that creditors &quot;cannot collect discharged debts,&quot;\n\nbut that a creditor with a lien may enforce a claim against the debtors&#x27; property\n\nsubject to that lien.\n\n      In the following January, plaintiff again sought to enforce the court&#x27;s prior\n\norders directing defendants to turnover funds and for 18% interest, which was\n\ngranted on April 12, 2024. In that order, the court added Vasquez and DCE-1\n\nand set the amount of the judgment at $1,625,900.68, inclusive of interest of\n\n18% per annum.\n\n      Approximately six months later, plaintiff filed its final motion in aid of\n\nlitigant&#x27;s rights, seeking a final judgment of $1,625,900.68 plus 18% interest.\n\nThe court granted plaintiff&#x27;s motion in its entirety, awarding attorney&#x27;s fees and\n\npost-judgment interest at 18% pursuant to the express terms of the parties&#x27;\n\nConsulting Agreement, and entered a final judgment on September 13, 2024.\n\n\n                                                                             A-0360-24\n                                        6\n\fThe court explained that although fee-shifting provisions are generally\n\ndisfavored, New Jersey law allowed the parties to contract for attorney &#x27;s fees,\n\nprovided the fees are reasonable. The court agreed the contractual interest rate\n\nwas expressly permitted based on the underlying agreement, and that the lower\n\nstatutory interest rate set forth under Rule 4:42-11(a) would not control. On\n\nSeptember 27, 2024, the court entered an amended judgment solely against\n\ndefendants DCE-1 and Vasquez in the amount of $1,625,900.68, plus\n\n$21,132.50 in attorney&#x27;s fees.\n\n      This appeal followed.\n\n                                      II.\n\n      The trial court&#x27;s factual findings &quot;are binding on appeal when supported\n\nby adequate, substantial, credible evidence.&quot; Seidman v.

Super. 346, 352</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (App.\n\nDiv. 2000).\n\n      Applying the requisite deferential standard, we reject appellants&#x27;\n\ncontention the default judgment entered in 2015 was &quot;defective&quot; and must be\n\nvoided.    Reviewing this same argument, the court properly considered\n\ndefendants&#x27; 2019 post-judgment action in response to plaintiff&#x27;s complaint and\n\nfound no basis to void the default judgment. As the court stated:\n\n              Mr. Marroquin admits receiving the complaint and\n              knew a default was going to be entered. He did not\n              deny hiring an attorney to attempt to negotiate a\n              settlement for himself and AGC-3. Under these\n              circumstances the court will not vacate the judgment.\n              The rules with regard to service are designed to [ensure]\n              parties receive notice. He has admitted he has received\n              notice.\n\nWe also note that plaintiff&#x27;s supplemental certification made as part of this\n\nrecord shows that shortly after service of the complaint, Marroquin&#x27;s counsel\n\n                                                                             A-0360-24\n                                         9\n\fcommunicated with plaintiff&#x27;s counsel regarding a possible settlement, which is\n\nindicative of Marroquin&#x27;s knowledge of the complaint. Thus, appellants cannot\n\nestablish a lack of actual notice of the action.\n\n      Moreover, the extensive record before us makes clear the parties have\n\nengaged in lengthy post-judgment litigation spanning approximately ten years,\n\nincluding multiple motions by plaintiff seeking to compel defendants to satisfy\n\nthe judgment entered against them. Against this backdrop, we are hard-pressed\n\nto conclude the court erred in its 2019 denial of defendants&#x27; application for\n\nvacatur of the 2015 default judgment. Rather, we agree with the court that\n\ndefendants asserted no basis to void the default judgment.\n\n                                         B.\n\n      Appellants next contend they were denied due process because they were\n\nadded to the action as judgment debtors only at the post-judgment enforcement\n\nstage, preventing them from taking discovery or presenting defenses . They\n\nmaintain that as non-parties to the initial lawsuit, they did not admit any debt\n\ndue under the Consulting Agreement as required by N.J.S.A. 2A:17-63. The\n\nstatute provides that after a levy upon a debt due to the judgment debtor from a\n\nthird party, the court may, upon notice and opportunity to contest, direct\n\npayment to the creditor if the court finds, based on the evidence and any\n\n\n                                                                          A-0360-24\n                                        10\n\fresponse from the garnishee, that a debt is in fact due. It does not require an\n\nexpress admission of liability by the garnishee.\n\n      Applying the plain language of the statute, we are unpersuaded by\n\nappellants&#x27; argument the turnover order was improper absent their admission of\n\nindebtedness. This argument is without merit and constitutes a misreading of\n\nthe statute. The statute is intended to authorize enforcement after a levy and\n\ncourt determination of a debt is due, following notice and opportunity to contest.\n\n      Here, the court considered Vasquez&#x27;s own testimony regarding the\n\nConsulting Agreement, payment records, and supporting documentation, and\n\nfound the debt owed to Marroquin under the Consulting Agreement was valid\n\nand subject to levy and turnover to Green Lago. Marroquin had notice of the\n\npost-judgment enforcement proceeding and participated in the subsequent\n\nmotion practice and neither Marroquin nor Vasquez appealed any court orders\n\nuntil the entry of the September 2024 amended final judgment.                 The\n\nrequirements of due process in post-judgment proceedings are more limited than\n\nat the merits stage: due process is satisfied if the nonparties, here DCE-1 and\n\nVasquez, receive reasonable notice and a meaningful opportunity to oppose\n\nexecution or contest their liability before funds are turned over or judgments are\n\nenforced.

We observe no error on the part of the\n\ncourt given the persistent withholding of funds from plaintiff.\n\n      Additionally, the record shows that following the entry of default\n\njudgment, Green Lago served Vasquez and DCE-1 with all relevant writs,\n\nmotions, and court orders, prompting Vasquez and DCE-1 to appear, submit\n\nwritten opposition, file certifications, and participate in motion hearings, thus\n\navailing themselves of all procedural and due process safeguards.\n\n                                       C.\n\n      We next turn to appellants&#x27; challenge to the turnover orders, as well as the\n\ncalculation of both the amount due and post-judgment interest. They argue the\n\ncourt exceeded its authority in determining the scope of the turnover orders and\n\nthe amount to be paid, and that any recovery by plaintiff was limited to sums\n\nactually accrued under the Consulting Agreement with Marroquin. They further\n\nmaintain that because Marroquin had been discharged in bankruptcy, plaintiff\n\n\n                                                                            A-0360-24\n                                      12\n\fcould not collect beyond what was independently due from Vasquez or DCE -1,\n\nand the court\u2019s orders impermissibly extended the reach of enforcement beyond\n\nthose limits. We are unpersuaded.\n\n      Appellants&#x27; challenge to the court&#x27;s grant of 18% per annum post-judgment\n\ninterest, in which they argue the court was constrained to apply the Rule 4:42-\n\n11(a) rate, is equally unavailing. 5 The court properly applied the contractual\n\nrate of 18% as set forth in the promissory note. Pursuant to basic breach of\n\ncontract principles, the promissory note provided for 18% interest and\n\ndefendants failed to demonstrate that 18% was unconscionable or contrary to\n\npublic policy.

Their argument is without merit\n\nas it is contrary to the express language of the discharge order.

R. 1:38-\n3(d).\n\fPER CURIAM\n\n      In this non-dissolution matter involving custody and parenting time,\n\ndefendant C.N. appeals from paragraphs one, two, and three of an April 3, 2024\n\nFamily Part order awarding plaintiff N.C. $130,653 in counsel fees. We reverse\n\nand remand the award of counsel fees because the judge did not analyze the\n\nfactors required by Rules 5:3-5(c), 4:42-9, and RPC 1.5(a).\n\n                                        I.\n\n      We derive the following facts and procedural history from the record. The\n\nparties were in a relationship from 2005 to 2011 but never married. They have\n\na child in common who was born in 2009. The parties initially agreed to a fifty -\n\nfifty parenting time arrangement. In 2019, both parties filed applications for\n\ncustody.   On February 12, 2020, the parties entered into a consent order\n\nresolving the custody and parenting time issues. Defendant was designated as\n\nthe parent of primary residence (PPR), and plaintiff was designated as the parent\n\nof alternate residence (PAR).\n\n      On April 19, 2022, plaintiff failed to produce the child for defendant's\n\nparenting time. The police were called, and the child was returned to defendant.\n\nAccording to defendant, the child explained that plaintiff screamed at her and\n\ntold her she could not leave until she took her sweatshirt off, believing the child\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                        2\n\fwas hiding cash stolen from her grandparents. The child alleged plaintiff patted\n\nher down, hit the child's arm, and \"squish[ed]\" her face.\n\n      Based on her suspicion plaintiff was physically abusing the child,\n\ndefendant filed an emergent order to show cause (OTSC) seeking sole legal and\n\nphysical custody and suspending plaintiff's parenting time and communications\n\nwith the child.     Defendant requested plaintiff undergo a psychological\n\nevaluation and risk assessment.        The Division of Child Protection and\n\nPermanency (DCPP) became involved and conducted an investigation. The\n\njudge denied the OTSC but suspended plaintiff's parenting time pending the\n\nDCPP investigation.\n\n      On May 11, 2022, plaintiff filed an OTSC seeking sole legal and\n\nresidential custody. In his certification in support of the OTSC, plaintiff stated\n\nthe child was speaking with adult strangers on the internet, selling pictures of\n\nher body for money, sexting with pornographic images, vaping, and stealing\n\nmoney to purchase sneakers. Plaintiff claimed defendant failed to acknowledge\n\nthe seriousness of the child's conduct, ignored communications from his\n\ncounsel, and feared the child might be sexually exploited or trafficked. Among\n\nother things, plaintiff certified defendant violated the terms of the consent order\n\nby taking the child from school during his parenting time, encouraging her to\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                        3\n\fhide in school bathrooms to avoid him, and using vacations and gifts to\n\nmanipulate her.\n\n      The judge denied plaintiff's application for sole legal and residential\n\ncustody and other relief sought. However, the judge ordered the child to refrain\n\nfrom using electronic devices except for supervised academic purposes. The\n\njudge found plaintiff's concerns about abduction or trafficking were speculative.\n\n      The parties engaged in further motion practice addressing parenting time\n\nissues, therapy, child support, medical, and other expenses. On October 28,\n\n2022, the judge entered an order granting plaintiff supervised parenting time.\n\nOn January 24, 2023, plaintiff filed a motion seeking a plenary hearing to change\n\ncustody and suspend defendant's parenting time pending a risk assessment.\n\nPlaintiff certified the child was suspended from school due to problematic\n\nbehavior and that he was never informed about it.\n\n      Defendant filed a cross-motion seeking to deny plaintiff's requested relief\n\nin his motion. Defendant sought to maintain the status quo custody arrangement.\n\nOn April 27, 2023, the judge ordered a five-day plenary hearing to occur\n\nbetween October and December 2023, following a period of discovery, to\n\naddress the issues raised in the motion and cross-motion and reserved decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-2806-23\n                                       4\n\f                          The January 26, 2024 Order\n\n      On January 26, 2024, the judge issued a written decision. The judge\n\ndetermined the parties would continue to have joint legal custody of the child\n\nbut transferred sole physical custody to plaintiff, designating him as the PPR\n\nand defendant as the PAR. The judge ordered the child to reside with plaintiff's\n\nparents and granted them joint legal custody until reunification therapy was\n\nsuccessful.   Defendant was granted parenting time every other weekend.\n\nPlaintiff was granted supervised parenting time with his parents acting as\n\nsupervisors. The judge analyzed the N.J.S.A. 9:2-4 factors and detailed his\n\nfindings. The judge terminated plaintiff's prior child support obligation.\n\n      The judge awarded plaintiff counsel fees and costs and directed his\n\ncounsel to submit a certification of services. In his decision, the judge cited\n\nRules 4:42-9(a)(1), 5:3-5(c), RPC 1.5(a), and the relevant case law. The judge\n\nreasoned much of the litigation between the parties was \"unnecessary\" and\n\n\"could have been avoided with cooperation or communication.\" The judge\n\nfound plaintiff's position on custody and parenting time was \"reasonable.\"\n\n      In addition, the judge determined defendant \"engaged in bad faith\n\nlitigation tactics\" and took \"unreasonable\" positions such as seeking sole legal\n\nand physical custody of the child. The judge noted defendant \"sought to thwart\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                        5\n\fthe parenting time arrangement and negate any chance of a loving bond\"\n\nbetween the child and plaintiff. The judge stressed defendant \"came before the\n\ncourt knowing that she has not complied with previous court [o]rders,\" refused\n\nto comply with the therapist's recommendations, and showed \"contemptuous\n\nbehavior all along.\"\n\n                            The April 3, 2024 Order\n\n      After considering the certification of services submitted by plaintiff's\n\ncounsel and the opposition filed by defendant's former counsel, the judge issued\n\nan order on April 3, 2024, granting plaintiff's counsel $130,653 for counsel fees\n\nand costs to be paid by defendant in two installments: $60,000 by June 14, 2024,\n\nand $70,653 by August 1, 2024. In his April 3, 2024 oral opinion, the judge\n\nheld the counsel fee award \"shall be non-dischargeable as a family support\n\nobligation.\" The judge referenced the statement of reasons from his January 26,\n\n2024 order. This appeal followed.\n\n      On appeal, defendant argues the April 3, 2024 order granting plaintiff fees\n\nand costs must be reversed because he did not satisfy his burden of proof\n\nentitling him to counsel fees. In the alternative, defendant contends a remand is\n\nnecessary because the judge's findings pertaining to counsel fees were\n\nincomplete and erroneous.      Defendant also asserts the judge abused his\n\n\n                                                                           A-2806-23\n                                       6\n\fdiscretion and went against the weight of the evidence in awarding counsel fees\n\nand costs to plaintiff. Defendant does not challenge the custody and parenting\n\ntime decisions on appeal.\n\n                                        II.\n\n      Counsel fee determinations, \"rest[] within the sound discretion of the trial\n\njudge.\" Gotlib v. Gotlib, 399 N.J. Super. 295, 314-15 (App. Div. 2008) (quoting\n\nLoro v. Colliano, 354 N.J. Super. 212, 227 (App. Div. 2002)). \"We will disturb\n\na trial court's determination on counsel fees only on the 'rarest occasion[],' and\n\nthen only because of clear abuse of discretion.\" Strahan v. Strahan, 402 N.J.\n\nSuper. 298, 317 (App. Div. 2008) (quoting Rendine v. Pantzer, 141 N.J. 292,\n\n317 (1995)).\n\n      Generally, \"the party requesting the fee award must be in financial need\n\nand the party paying the fees must have the financial ability to pay, and if those\n\ntwo factors have been established, the party requesting the fees must have acted\n\nin good faith in the litigation.\" J.E.V. v. K.V., 426 N.J. Super. 475, 493 (App.\n\nDiv. 2012) (citing Guglielmo v. Guglielmo, 253 N.J. Super. 531, 545 (App. Div.\n\n1992)). When both parties have a \"sufficient ability to satisfy [their] attorney's\n\nfee obligation, and neither . . . proceeded in bad faith,\" the court may justifiably\n\ndeny the award of counsel fees. Reese v. Weis, 430 N.J. Super. 552, 586 (App.\n\n\n                                                                              A-2806-23\n                                         7\n\fDiv. 2013). Rule 4:42-9(a)(1) authorizes a court to make a fee allowance both\n\npendente lite and on final determination, pursuant to Rule 5:3-5(c). Rule 5:3-\n\n5(c) provides a court with the discretion to make an allowance of counsel fees\n\nin family matters, if supported by an affidavit of services, and provides factors\n\nfor analyzing an award of counsel fees. The court considers the following\n\nfactors:\n\n            (1) the financial circumstances of the parties;\n\n            (2) the ability of the parties to pay their own fees or to\n            contribute to the fees of the other party;\n\n            (3) the reasonableness and good faith of the positions\n            advanced by the parties both during and prior to trial;\n\n            (4) the extent of the fees incurred by both parties;\n\n            (5) any fees previously awarded;\n\n            (6) the amount of fees previously paid to counsel by\n            each party;\n\n            (7) the results obtained;\n\n            (8) the degree to which fees were incurred to enforce\n            existing orders or to compel discovery; and\n\n            (9) any other factor bearing on the fairness of an award.\n\n            [R. 5:3-5(c).]\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-2806-23\n                                        8\n\f      Rule 5:3-5(c) also addresses the factors enumerated by RPC 1.5(a), which\n\nultimately requires a lawyer's fee to be reasonable. RPC 1.5(a) requires the court\n\nto consider the following factors:\n\n            (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and\n            difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill\n            requisite to perform the legal service properly; (2) the\n            likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance\n            of the particular employment will preclude other\n            employment by the lawyer; (3) the fee customarily\n            charged in the locality for similar legal services; (4) the\n            amount involved and the results obtained; (5) the time\n            limitations imposed by the client or by the\n            circumstances; (6) the nature and length of the\n            professional relationship with the client; (7) the\n            experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or\n            lawyers performing the services; and (8) whether the\n            fee is fixed or contingent.\n\n            [RPC 1.5(a).]\n\n      A trial court's failure to consider the appropriate factors, make the\n\nrequired findings, and state its conclusions of law, constitutes a clear abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Saffos v. Avaya, Inc., 419 N.J. Super. 244, 271 (App. Div.\n\n2011). Ordinarily, the purpose of a counsel fee award in a matrimonial action\n\nis to equalize the relative financial resources of the parties. J.E.V., 426 N.J.\n\nSuper. at 493 (citing Kelly v. Kelly, 262 N.J. Super. 303, 307 (Ch. Div. 1992)).\n\n      \"Simple omnibus references to the rules without sufficient findings to\n\njustify a counsel fee award makes meaningful review of such an award\n\n                                                                            A-2806-23\n                                        9\n\fimpossible . . .\" Loro, 354 N.J. Super. at 228. If the court performs its obligation\n\nunder the statute and rules, and \"there is satisfactory evidentiary support for the\n\ntrial court's findings, 'its task is complete and [a reviewing court] should not\n\ndisturb the result, even though it . . . might have reached a different conclusion\n\nwere it the trial tribunal.'\" Reese, 430 N.J. Super. at 568 (quoting Beck v. Beck,\n\n86 N.J. 480, 496 (App. Div. 2013)). Conversely, a remand is appropriate if the\n\ntrial court fails to adequately explain an award or denial of counsel fees. See\n\nGiarusso v. Giarusso, 455 N.J. Super. 42, 54 (App. Div. 2018) (citing Loro, 354\n\nN.J. Super. at 227-28).\n\n                                         III.\n\n                                         A.\n\n      Defendant first argues the judge erred in granting plaintiff counsel fees\n\nand costs because he failed to meet his burden of proof under N.J.R.E. 101(b),\n\nwhich addresses the obligation a party must meet in order to prevail on a claim\n\nor defense. Defendant maintains plaintiff's counsel's certification of services\n\ndid not adequately address many of the pertinent factors.             In particular,\n\ndefendant contends Rule 5:3-5(c)(1) was not addressed regarding the financial\n\ncircumstances of the parties other than one statement: \"Upon information and\n\nbelief, . . . [d]efendant can and should contribute to [p]laintiff's fees.\"\n\n\n                                                                              A-2806-23\n                                        10\n\f      In a similar vein, defendant argues under Rule 5:3-5(c)(2), plaintiff did\n\nnot submit or prove anything regarding his ability to contribute towards his own\n\nfees or defendant's ability to contribute towards his fees. Defendant's prior\n\nattorney filed opposition to plaintiff's counsel's certification of services pointing\n\nout plaintiff's financial circumstances are unknown, but that he was either\n\nwillfully refusing or not financially able to pay his six dollars per week child\n\nsupport obligation.\n\n      Based upon our review of the record, we conclude the judge did not make\n\nsufficient findings under Rules 5:3-5(c)(1) and 5:3-5(c)(2), 4:42-9, and RPC\n\n1.5(a) regarding the financial circumstances of the parties and defendant's ability\n\nto pay plaintiff's counsel fees and costs. Thus, we are constrained to reverse\n\nparagraphs one, two, and three of the April 3, 2024 order awarding plaintiff\n\nattorney's fees and costs and remand for the judge to consider these requisite\n\nfactors and conduct the appropriate analysis.\n\n      We note the judge did mention that defendant earned \"$70,000 plus\"\n\nduring the 2023 tax year based on her W-2, but that was the extent of the\n\nanalysis.   No case information statements were submitted for the judge's\n\nconsideration. The judge also failed to consider that defendant did not seek to\n\nhave plaintiff contribute to her fees.\n\n\n                                                                               A-2806-23\n                                         11\n\f                                        B.\n\n      Next, defendant argues the judge failed to consider Rule 5:3-5(c)(3), the\n\nreasonableness and good faith positions advanced by the parties both during and\n\nprior to trial. According to defendant, plaintiff's counsel and the judge failed to\n\naddress the reasonableness of plaintiff's positions throughout the litigation.\n\nDefendant asserts the judge's finding of bad faith on her part was \"objectively\n\nquestionable\" because if plaintiff had explained the reasonableness of his\n\nposition, then the judge could have found her position was equally valid. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n      On this factor, the judge explicitly mentioned the reasonableness of the\n\nparties' positions in his January 26, 2024 decision.        Moreover, the judge\n\nhighlighted plaintiff's positions relating to custody and parenting time were\n\nreasonable because he had to enforce prior court orders and ensure the best\n\ninterests of the child. We discern no abuse of discretion on this factor.\n\n      Defendant argues a parent's position in a custody litigation matter comes\n\nwith a presumption of good faith and that the request is made in the best interests\n\nof their child. See Moriarty v. Bradt, 177 N.J. 84, 101-04 (2003). She argues\n\ncourts have defined bad faith as \"not simply bad judgment or negligence,\n\nrather[,] it implies the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                       12\n\for moral obliquity. It is different from the negative idea of negligence in that it\n\ncontemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or ill\n\nwill.\" Borzillo v. Borzillo, 259 N.J. Super. 286, 292 (Ch. Div. 1992).\n\n      Defendant also cites Kelly v. Kelly, 262 N.J. Super. 303 (Ch. Div. 1992),\n\nfor the proposition that plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence of her bad\n\nfaith. In Kelly, the trial court found that \"so long as the position assumed is not\n\nmotivated by an attempt to 'torture' the other party, bad faith cannot be found.\"\n\nId. at 310. In the matter under review, defendant avers most of the litigation\n\nthroughout the years was instituted by plaintiff and not her. Further, defendant\n\nargues that \"even if there was bad faith, an award based on bad faith is simply\n\nto compensate the other party for fees reasonably expended.\" See Mayer v.\n\nMayer, 180 N.J. Super. 164, 169 (App. Div. 1981); Yueh v. Yueh, 329 N.J.\n\nSuper. 447, 468-69 (App. Div. 2000).\n\n      Defendant contends \"counsel fees may not be assessed in a family action\n\nas a sanction for asserting an unsuccessful claim or raising an unsuccessful\n\ndefense.\" See Darmanin v. Darmanin, 224 N.J. Super. 427, 428 (App. Div.\n\n1988); Ridley v. Dennison, 298 N.J. Super. 373, 381 (App. Div. 1997) (an award\n\nof fees should not be imposed merely as a punitive measure); Savoie v. Savoie,\n\n245 N.J. Super. 1, 7-8 (App. Div. 1990) (an award of fees may not be based\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                       13\n\fsolely on the desire or need to punish a party); P.T. v. M.S., 325 N.J. Super. 193,\n\n220 (App. Div. 1999) (sanctions should not be used for the purpose of\n\npunishment).\n\n      Here, the judge provided detailed reasons for finding that Rule 5:3-5(c)(3)\n\nweighed in favor of awarding plaintiff counsel fees and costs. The judge\n\ncarefully considered the purpose of awarding counsel fees to a party when bad\n\nfaith is present, or \"to protect the innocent party from unnecessary costs and to\n\npunish the guilty party.\" Welch v. Welch, 401 N.J. Super. 438, 448 (Ch. Div.\n\n2008) (citing Yueh, 329 N.J. Super. at 461). The judge reasoned an award of\n\ncounsel fees can be used to prevent a \"maliciously motivated party from\n\ninflicting economic damage,\" to another party. Kelly, 262 N.J. Super. at 307.\n\nIn addition, the judge emphasized that when a court finds there is bad faith, the\n\ninnocent party who seeks counsel fees does not need to show a financial need\n\nfor a counsel fee award. Ibid. See also Yueh, 329 N.J. Super. at 461. Instead,\n\nthe judge reasoned a showing of bad faith includes:\n\n            the intentional non-compliance with court [o]rders and\n            settlement agreements; (2) seeking relief that one\n            knows or should know that no reasonable argument\n            could be advanced in fact or law in support hereof; and\n            (3) misrepresentation of facts or law designed or\n            intended to discharge or improperly limit equitable\n            distribution or support obligations.\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                       14\n\f            [Borzillo, 259 N.J. Super. at 293-94.]\n\n      Moreover, the judge found defendant lied under oath when she stated she\n\nhad never been arrested. Defendant also admitted she \"lied\" in a previous\n\ncustody proceeding with her current husband regarding abuse, in an attempt to\n\nobtain sole custody of their son. And, defendant was likewise incredulous in\n\nrelation to her allegation that plaintiff sexually touched the child, as the child\n\ntold defendant it happened, but defendant nonetheless never reported the alleged\n\nincident to the police.\n\n      The judge determined this alleged incident was an \"illusory account\n\ndrummed up by defendant to attempt to ensure plaintiff is banned from her life\n\nand the child's life.\" Thus, we are satisfied the judge made the requisite findings\n\nfor a showing of bad faith under Rule 5:3-5(c)(3).\n\n                                        C.\n\n      Next, defendant argues the judge incorrectly analyzed Rule 5:3-5(c)(4),\n\nthe extent of fees incurred by both parties. By way of example, defendant argues\n\nplaintiff's counsel improperly submitted invoices, which totaled $185,958.11.\n\nDefendant challenges the invoices on the basis the actual incurred fees exceeded\n\nthe scope of the retainer agreement and the plenary hearing because the retainer\n\nagreement was limited to \"research and review of claims only\" and did not\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                       15\n\fspecifically include pleadings or court appearances. Defendant also questions a\n\n$15,000 charge for professional services performed subsequent to the plenary\n\nhearing.\n\n      When calculating the amount of reasonable attorney's fees, courts must\n\ndetermine the lodestar, defined as the \"the number of hours reasonably expended\n\nmultiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.\" Rendine, 141 N.J. at 334-5. Factors\n\nthat the court must consider when awarding attorney's fees include the RPC\n\n1.5(a) factors. Hansen v. Rite Aid Corp., 253 N.J. 191, 213-14 (2023) (quoting\n\nRPC 1.5(a)).\n\n      \"The court must not include excessive and unnecessary hours spent on the\n\ncase in calculating the lodestar.\" Furst v. Einstein Moomjy, Inc., 182 N.J. 1, 22\n\n(2004). Therefore, the amount of the lodestar \"may be reduced[.]\" R.M. v. Sup.\n\nCt. of N.J., 190 N.J. 1, 11 (2007).       Ultimately, the \"goal is to approve a\n\nreasonable attorney's fee that is not excessive.\" Litton Indus., Inc. v. IMO\n\nIndus., Inc., 200 N.J. 372, 388 (2009).\n\n      Our review of the record reveals the judge failed to explain why he\n\nconsidered fees involving motions defendant was not involved with in rendering\n\nthe counsel fee award. For example, plaintiff filed a motion to implead the\n\nSomerville School District and a motion to compel discovery not seeking relief\n\n\n                                                                           A-2806-23\n                                      16\n\for compliance from defendant. The judge's award is also inconsistent because\n\nin some instances duplicate staffing charges were deducted, while other similar\n\nentries had no deduction. On remand, the judge shall consider his analysis under\n\nRule 5:3-5(c)(4) anew and consistent with our holding in J.E.V., 426 N.J. Super.\n\nat 494.\n\n                                      D.\n\n      Defendant maintains the judge incorrectly analyzed Rule 5:3-5(c)(5)\n\nbecause he considered the $750 that the Somerville School District paid as\n\ncontribution although this order did not concern her. Defendant points out there\n\nwas \"no prior order in which fees were previously awarded,\" as plaintiff\n\npreviously applied for and was denied an award of counsel fees on the basis he\n\n\"did not engage in good faith.\"\n\n      Defendant's argument has merit. On remand, the judge shall make the\n\nrequisite findings under Rule 5:3-5(c)(5) relative to the $750 paid by the\n\nSomerville School District.\n\n                                       E.\n\n      Regarding Rule 5:3-5(c)(6), defendant claims the judge improperly\n\nanalyzed this factor because the record is devoid of any documented proof of\n\npayments made to plaintiff's counsel. For instance, there is reference to an\n\n\n                                                                          A-2806-23\n                                      17\n\f$84,500 payment made by plaintiff, but such payment was unsupported by any\n\nproof. Additionally, defendant contends the judge found she incurred $31,000\n\nin counsel fees when, realistically the amount was much higher. Defendant\n\nfurther questioned why the $31,000 amount was reduced, without explanation,\n\nto $14,812.61.\n\n      On remand, the judge shall make appropriate findings under Rule 5:3-\n\n5(c)(6) and consider defendant's argument that the $31,000 in counsel fees\n\nrepresents the amount she paid to her newly retained counsel, not what she\n\nincurred previously in making his determination.\n\n                                       F.\n\n      Next, defendant argues the judge improperly analyzed Rule 5:3-5(c)(7),\n\nwhich overlaps with RPC 1.5(a)(4), by finding it weighs in plaintiff's favor.\n\nDefendant argues the judge's decision on custody and parenting time w as\n\n\"punitive\" towards her but were not in plaintiff's favor either because the order\n\nawarded plaintiff's parents temporary sole custody of the child. Defendant\n\nmaintains plaintiff previously had a \"near shared equal parenting arr angement,\"\n\nand the new January 26, 2024 order relegated him to supervised parenting time\n\nwith a limited schedule. We are unpersuaded.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-2806-23\n                                      18\n\f      While the judge recognized plaintiff's motion for sole legal and residential\n\ncustody was denied, the judge recognized plaintiff was the prevailing party at\n\nthe plenary hearing. Plaintiff was awarded full custody, with his parents being\n\ngranted temporary custody until reunification therapy was completed.\n\nTherefore, we reject defendant's argument that Rule 5:3-5(c)(7) was not properly\n\nanalyzed.\n\n                                       G.\n\n      Defendant maintains the judge failed to address Rule 5:3-5(c)(8), the\n\ndegree to which fees were incurred to enforce existing orders to compel\n\ndiscovery. Defendant points out plaintiff did not file any motions to compel\n\ndiscovery against her individually. The only motion filed to compel discovery\n\ninvolved the Somerville School District. Plaintiff's counsel certified defendant\n\nwas \"non-responsive and untruthful\" in regard to discovery but did not detail\n\nwhat fees plaintiff incurred to enforce any specific discovery orders.\n\n      Here, the judge merely stated \"there was an issue with . . . defendant being\n\nnot responsive to discovery,\" and he did not elaborate further. On remand, the\n\njudge shall conduct the requisite analysis and make appropriate findings under\n\nRule 5:3-5(a)(8).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-2806-23\n                                      19\n\f                                        H.\n\n      Defendant argues the judge explicitly stated that Rule 5:3-5(a)(9), any\n\nother factor bearing on the fairness of the award, weighed in favor of plaintiff\n\nbut did not undertake the requisite analysis. It is unclear from the record whether\n\nthe judge incorporated the bad faith analysis into his decision. On remand, the\n\njudge shall provide the requisite analysis and findings under Rule 5:3-5(c)(9).\n\n                                       IV.\n\n      The judge also analyzed the RPC 1.5(a) factors and supplemented his\n\nfindings by considering \"the nature and extent of the services rendered ; and the\n\nreasonableness of the fees.\" Mani v. Mani, 183 N.J. 70, 94-95 (2005). In her\n\nopposition papers, defendant argued the matter was essentially an \"FD summary\n\naction\" involving custody and parenting time and was \"over-lawyered\" by\n\nplaintiff's counsel. Defendant contends plaintiff did not cooperate with the\n\npolice or DCPP, and no expert witnesses were retained.\n\n      In his decision, the judge only stated, \"certainly there was time and labor\n\nrequired by [plaintiff's] attorney[s'],\" and \"this has been an ongoing parenting\n\ntime issue and custody issue spanning months and months, if not years and\n\nyears.\" Defendant reiterates the plenary hearing only spanned four days, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                       20\n\fissues were \"simple,\" but failed to find how plaintiff's attorneys were precluded\n\nfrom other work.\n\n      The judge did not explain how the requested amount of $186,611.11 by\n\nplaintiff was reasonable in sufficient detail. We note the judge considered\n\ncertain duplicative and unnecessary services, and the payment from the\n\nSomerville School District, and reduced plaintiff's counsel's requested hourly\n\nfee from $425 to $415 per hour. There is an inadequate discussion of the RPC\n\n1.5(a) factors, warranting a remand.\n\n      In sum, we conclude the judge did not make detailed findings under Rules\n\n5:3-5(c), 4:42-9, and RPC 1.5(a) as stated in this opinion. Thus, we reverse and\n\nremand for the judge to consider the requisite factors and conduct the\n\nappropriate analyses. We have no opinion on the outcome of the counsel fee\n\ndecision.\n\n      We conclude the remaining arguments\u2014to the extent we have not\n\naddressed them\u2014lack sufficient merit to warrant any further discussion in a\n\nwritten opinion.

We reverse\n\nand remand the award of counsel fees because the judge did not analyze the\n\nfactors required by Rules 5:3-5(c), 4:42-9, and RPC 1.5(a).\n\n                                        I.\n\n      We derive the following facts and procedural history from the record. The\n\nparties were in a relationship from 2005 to 2011 but never married. They have\n\na child in common who was born in 2009. The parties initially agreed to a fifty -\n\nfifty parenting time arrangement. In 2019, both parties filed applications for\n\ncustody.   On February 12, 2020, the parties entered into a consent order\n\nresolving the custody and parenting time issues. Defendant was designated as\n\nthe parent of primary residence (PPR), and plaintiff was designated as the parent\n\nof alternate residence (PAR).\n\n      On April 19, 2022, plaintiff failed to produce the child for defendant&#x27;s\n\nparenting time. The police were called, and the child was returned to defendant.\n\nAccording to defendant, the child explained that plaintiff screamed at her and\n\ntold her she could not leave until she took her sweatshirt off, believing the child\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                        2\n\fwas hiding cash stolen from her grandparents. The child alleged plaintiff patted\n\nher down, hit the child&#x27;s arm, and &quot;squish[ed]&quot; her face.\n\n      Based on her suspicion plaintiff was physically abusing the child,\n\ndefendant filed an emergent order to show cause (OTSC) seeking sole legal and\n\nphysical custody and suspending plaintiff&#x27;s parenting time and communications\n\nwith the child.     Defendant requested plaintiff undergo a psychological\n\nevaluation and risk assessment.        The Division of Child Protection and\n\nPermanency (DCPP) became involved and conducted an investigation. The\n\njudge denied the OTSC but suspended plaintiff&#x27;s parenting time pending the\n\nDCPP investigation.\n\n      On May 11, 2022, plaintiff filed an OTSC seeking sole legal and\n\nresidential custody. In his certification in support of the OTSC, plaintiff stated\n\nthe child was speaking with adult strangers on the internet, selling pictures of\n\nher body for money, sexting with pornographic images, vaping, and stealing\n\nmoney to purchase sneakers. Plaintiff claimed defendant failed to acknowledge\n\nthe seriousness of the child&#x27;s conduct, ignored communications from his\n\ncounsel, and feared the child might be sexually exploited or trafficked. Among\n\nother things, plaintiff certified defendant violated the terms of the consent order\n\nby taking the child from school during his parenting time, encouraging her to\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                        3\n\fhide in school bathrooms to avoid him, and using vacations and gifts to\n\nmanipulate her.\n\n      The judge denied plaintiff&#x27;s application for sole legal and residential\n\ncustody and other relief sought. However, the judge ordered the child to refrain\n\nfrom using electronic devices except for supervised academic purposes. The\n\njudge found plaintiff&#x27;s concerns about abduction or trafficking were speculative.\n\n      The parties engaged in further motion practice addressing parenting time\n\nissues, therapy, child support, medical, and other expenses. On October 28,\n\n2022, the judge entered an order granting plaintiff supervised parenting time.\n\nOn January 24, 2023, plaintiff filed a motion seeking a plenary hearing to change\n\ncustody and suspend defendant&#x27;s parenting time pending a risk assessment.\n\nPlaintiff certified the child was suspended from school due to problematic\n\nbehavior and that he was never informed about it.\n\n      Defendant filed a cross-motion seeking to deny plaintiff&#x27;s requested relief\n\nin his motion. Defendant sought to maintain the status quo custody arrangement.\n\nOn April 27, 2023, the judge ordered a five-day plenary hearing to occur\n\nbetween October and December 2023, following a period of discovery, to\n\naddress the issues raised in the motion and cross-motion and reserved decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-2806-23\n                                       4\n\f                          The January 26, 2024 Order\n\n      On January 26, 2024, the judge issued a written decision. The judge\n\ndetermined the parties would continue to have joint legal custody of the child\n\nbut transferred sole physical custody to plaintiff, designating him as the PPR\n\nand defendant as the PAR. The judge ordered the child to reside with plaintiff&#x27;s\n\nparents and granted them joint legal custody until reunification therapy was\n\nsuccessful.   Defendant was granted parenting time every other weekend.\n\nPlaintiff was granted supervised parenting time with his parents acting as\n\nsupervisors. The judge analyzed the N.J.S.A. 9:2-4 factors and detailed his\n\nfindings. The judge terminated plaintiff&#x27;s prior child support obligation.\n\n      The judge awarded plaintiff counsel fees and costs and directed his\n\ncounsel to submit a certification of services. In his decision, the judge cited\n\nRules 4:42-9(a)(1), 5:3-5(c), RPC 1.5(a), and the relevant case law. The judge\n\nreasoned much of the litigation between the parties was &quot;unnecessary&quot; and\n\n&quot;could have been avoided with cooperation or communication.&quot; The judge\n\nfound plaintiff&#x27;s position on custody and parenting time was &quot;reasonable.&quot;\n\n      In addition, the judge determined defendant &quot;engaged in bad faith\n\nlitigation tactics&quot; and took &quot;unreasonable&quot; positions such as seeking sole legal\n\nand physical custody of the child. The judge noted defendant &quot;sought to thwart\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                        5\n\fthe parenting time arrangement and negate any chance of a loving bond&quot;\n\nbetween the child and plaintiff. The judge stressed defendant &quot;came before the\n\ncourt knowing that she has not complied with previous court [o]rders,&quot; refused\n\nto comply with the therapist&#x27;s recommendations, and showed &quot;contemptuous\n\nbehavior all along.&quot;\n\n                            The April 3, 2024 Order\n\n      After considering the certification of services submitted by plaintiff&#x27;s\n\ncounsel and the opposition filed by defendant&#x27;s former counsel, the judge issued\n\nan order on April 3, 2024, granting plaintiff&#x27;s counsel $130,653 for counsel fees\n\nand costs to be paid by defendant in two installments: $60,000 by June 14, 2024,\n\nand $70,653 by August 1, 2024. In his April 3, 2024 oral opinion, the judge\n\nheld the counsel fee award &quot;shall be non-dischargeable as a family support\n\nobligation.&quot; The judge referenced the statement of reasons from his January 26,\n\n2024 order. This appeal followed.\n\n      On appeal, defendant argues the April 3, 2024 order granting plaintiff fees\n\nand costs must be reversed because he did not satisfy his burden of proof\n\nentitling him to counsel fees. In the alternative, defendant contends a remand is\n\nnecessary because the judge&#x27;s findings pertaining to counsel fees were\n\nincomplete and erroneous.      Defendant also asserts the judge abused his\n\n\n                                                                           A-2806-23\n                                       6\n\fdiscretion and went against the weight of the evidence in awarding counsel fees\n\nand costs to plaintiff.

Defendant maintains plaintiff&#x27;s counsel&#x27;s certification of services\n\ndid not adequately address many of the pertinent factors.             In particular,\n\ndefendant contends Rule 5:3-5(c)(1) was not addressed regarding the financial\n\ncircumstances of the parties other than one statement: &quot;Upon information and\n\nbelief, . . . [d]efendant can and should contribute to [p]laintiff&#x27;s fees.&quot;\n\n\n                                                                              A-2806-23\n                                        10\n\f      In a similar vein, defendant argues under Rule 5:3-5(c)(2), plaintiff did\n\nnot submit or prove anything regarding his ability to contribute towards his own\n\nfees or defendant&#x27;s ability to contribute towards his fees. Defendant&#x27;s prior\n\nattorney filed opposition to plaintiff&#x27;s counsel&#x27;s certification of services pointing\n\nout plaintiff&#x27;s financial circumstances are unknown, but that he was either\n\nwillfully refusing or not financially able to pay his six dollars per week child\n\nsupport obligation.\n\n      Based upon our review of the record, we conclude the judge did not make\n\nsufficient findings under Rules 5:3-5(c)(1) and 5:3-5(c)(2), 4:42-9, and RPC\n\n1.5(a) regarding the financial circumstances of the parties and defendant&#x27;s ability\n\nto pay plaintiff&#x27;s counsel fees and costs. Thus, we are constrained to reverse\n\nparagraphs one, two, and three of the April 3, 2024 order awarding plaintiff\n\nattorney&#x27;s fees and costs and remand for the judge to consider these requisite\n\nfactors and conduct the appropriate analysis.\n\n      We note the judge did mention that defendant earned &quot;$70,000 plus&quot;\n\nduring the 2023 tax year based on her W-2, but that was the extent of the\n\nanalysis.   No case information statements were submitted for the judge&#x27;s\n\nconsideration. The judge also failed to consider that defendant did not seek to\n\nhave plaintiff contribute to her fees.\n\n\n                                                                               A-2806-23\n                                         11\n\f                                        B.\n\n      Next, defendant argues the judge failed to consider Rule 5:3-5(c)(3), the\n\nreasonableness and good faith positions advanced by the parties both during and\n\nprior to trial. According to defendant, plaintiff&#x27;s counsel and the judge failed to\n\naddress the reasonableness of plaintiff&#x27;s positions throughout the litigation.\n\nDefendant asserts the judge&#x27;s finding of bad faith on her part was &quot;objectively\n\nquestionable&quot; because if plaintiff had explained the reasonableness of his\n\nposition, then the judge could have found her position was equally valid. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n      On this factor, the judge explicitly mentioned the reasonableness of the\n\nparties&#x27; positions in his January 26, 2024 decision.        Moreover, the judge\n\nhighlighted plaintiff&#x27;s positions relating to custody and parenting time were\n\nreasonable because he had to enforce prior court orders and ensure the best\n\ninterests of the child. We discern no abuse of discretion on this factor.\n\n      Defendant argues a parent&#x27;s position in a custody litigation matter comes\n\nwith a presumption of good faith and that the request is made in the best interests\n\nof their child.

Defendant also admitted she &quot;lied&quot; in a previous\n\ncustody proceeding with her current husband regarding abuse, in an attempt to\n\nobtain sole custody of their son. And, defendant was likewise incredulous in\n\nrelation to her allegation that plaintiff sexually touched the child, as the child\n\ntold defendant it happened, but defendant nonetheless never reported the alleged\n\nincident to the police.\n\n      The judge determined this alleged incident was an &quot;illusory account\n\ndrummed up by defendant to attempt to ensure plaintiff is banned from her life\n\nand the child&#x27;s life.&quot; Thus, we are satisfied the judge made the requisite findings\n\nfor a showing of bad faith under Rule 5:3-5(c)(3).\n\n                                        C.\n\n      Next, defendant argues the judge incorrectly analyzed Rule 5:3-5(c)(4),\n\nthe extent of fees incurred by both parties.

Defendant points out there\n\nwas &quot;no prior order in which fees were previously awarded,&quot; as plaintiff\n\npreviously applied for and was denied an award of counsel fees on the basis he\n\n&quot;did not engage in good faith.&quot;\n\n      Defendant&#x27;s argument has merit. On remand, the judge shall make the\n\nrequisite findings under Rule 5:3-5(c)(5) relative to the $750 paid by the\n\nSomerville School District.\n\n                                       E.\n\n      Regarding Rule 5:3-5(c)(6), defendant claims the judge improperly\n\nanalyzed this factor because the record is devoid of any documented proof of\n\npayments made to plaintiff&#x27;s counsel. For instance, there is reference to an\n\n\n                                                                          A-2806-23\n                                      17\n\f$84,500 payment made by plaintiff, but such payment was unsupported by any\n\nproof. Additionally, defendant contends the judge found she incurred $31,000\n\nin counsel fees when, realistically the amount was much higher. Defendant\n\nfurther questioned why the $31,000 amount was reduced, without explanation,\n\nto $14,812.61.\n\n      On remand, the judge shall make appropriate findings under Rule 5:3-\n\n5(c)(6) and consider defendant&#x27;s argument that the $31,000 in counsel fees\n\nrepresents the amount she paid to her newly retained counsel, not what she\n\nincurred previously in making his determination.\n\n                                       F.\n\n      Next, defendant argues the judge improperly analyzed Rule 5:3-5(c)(7),\n\nwhich overlaps with RPC 1.5(a)(4), by finding it weighs in plaintiff&#x27;s favor.\n\nDefendant argues the judge&#x27;s decision on custody and parenting time w as\n\n&quot;punitive&quot; towards her but were not in plaintiff&#x27;s favor either because the order\n\nawarded plaintiff&#x27;s parents temporary sole custody of the child. Defendant\n\nmaintains plaintiff previously had a &quot;near shared equal parenting arr angement,&quot;\n\nand the new January 26, 2024 order relegated him to supervised parenting time\n\nwith a limited schedule. We are unpersuaded.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-2806-23\n                                      18\n\f      While the judge recognized plaintiff&#x27;s motion for sole legal and residential\n\ncustody was denied, the judge recognized plaintiff was the prevailing party at\n\nthe plenary hearing. Plaintiff was awarded full custody, with his parents being\n\ngranted temporary custody until reunification therapy was completed.\n\nTherefore, we reject defendant&#x27;s argument that Rule 5:3-5(c)(7) was not properly\n\nanalyzed.\n\n                                       G.\n\n      Defendant maintains the judge failed to address Rule 5:3-5(c)(8), the\n\ndegree to which fees were incurred to enforce existing orders to compel\n\ndiscovery. Defendant points out plaintiff did not file any motions to compel\n\ndiscovery against her individually. The only motion filed to compel discovery\n\ninvolved the Somerville School District. Plaintiff&#x27;s counsel certified defendant\n\nwas &quot;non-responsive and untruthful&quot; in regard to discovery but did not detail\n\nwhat fees plaintiff incurred to enforce any specific discovery orders.\n\n      Here, the judge merely stated &quot;there was an issue with . . . defendant being\n\nnot responsive to discovery,&quot; and he did not elaborate further. On remand, the\n\njudge shall conduct the requisite analysis and make appropriate findings under\n\nRule 5:3-5(a)(8).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-2806-23\n                                      19\n\f                                        H.\n\n      Defendant argues the judge explicitly stated that Rule 5:3-5(a)(9), any\n\nother factor bearing on the fairness of the award, weighed in favor of plaintiff\n\nbut did not undertake the requisite analysis. It is unclear from the record whether\n\nthe judge incorporated the bad faith analysis into his decision. On remand, the\n\njudge shall provide the requisite analysis and findings under Rule 5:3-5(c)(9).\n\n                                       IV.\n\n      The judge also analyzed the RPC 1.5(a) factors and supplemented his\n\nfindings by considering &quot;the nature and extent of the services rendered ; and the\n\nreasonableness of the fees.&quot; Mani v.

In her\n\nopposition papers, defendant argued the matter was essentially an &quot;FD summary\n\naction&quot; involving custody and parenting time and was &quot;over-lawyered&quot; by\n\nplaintiff&#x27;s counsel. Defendant contends plaintiff did not cooperate with the\n\npolice or DCPP, and no expert witnesses were retained.\n\n      In his decision, the judge only stated, &quot;certainly there was time and labor\n\nrequired by [plaintiff&#x27;s] attorney[s&#x27;],&quot; and &quot;this has been an ongoing parenting\n\ntime issue and custody issue spanning months and months, if not years and\n\nyears.&quot; Defendant reiterates the plenary hearing only spanned four days, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-2806-23\n                                       20\n\fissues were &quot;simple,&quot; but failed to find how plaintiff&#x27;s attorneys were precluded\n\nfrom other work.\n\n      The judge did not explain how the requested amount of $186,611.11 by\n\nplaintiff was reasonable in sufficient detail. We note the judge considered\n\ncertain duplicative and unnecessary services, and the payment from the\n\nSomerville School District, and reduced plaintiff&#x27;s counsel&#x27;s requested hourly\n\nfee from $425 to $415 per hour. There is an inadequate discussion of the RPC\n\n1.5(a) factors, warranting a remand.\n\n      In sum, we conclude the judge did not make detailed findings under Rules\n\n5:3-5(c), 4:42-9, and RPC 1.5(a) as stated in this opinion. Thus, we reverse and\n\nremand for the judge to consider the requisite factors and conduct the\n\nappropriate analyses. We have no opinion on the outcome of the counsel fee\n\ndecision.\n\n      We conclude the remaining arguments\u2014to the extent we have not\n\naddressed them\u2014lack sufficient merit to warrant any further discussion in a\n\nwritten opinion.

Walsh's comprehensive and well-reasoned written\n\nopinion.\n\n\n                                                                        A-3086-23\n                                      2\n\f                                       I.\n\n      We summarize the facts supported by competent evidence in the record\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs. See Brill v. Guardian Life Ins.\n\nCo. of Am., 142 N.J. 520, 540 (1995). Plaintiffs reside at 313 Myrtle Avenue\n\nin Westfield, which they purchased in 2015. Sitescapes owns and operates its\n\nbusinesses at 680 Myrtle Avenue in Garwood (the Property), which is adjacent\n\nto plaintiffs' property.\n\n      The Property is located within the Borough's single-family residential\n\nzone but has been the site of non-conforming commercial operations including\n\nindustrial fabrication, masonry and heavy construction, roofing, and landscaping\n\nsince at least 1970. In 1974, the Property was purchased by M. Hirsch & Sons,\n\nInc. On September 12, 1974, the Borough issued a certificate of occupancy to\n\n\"F. Hirsch\" to use the Property \"for the purposes of a private garage.\" Effective\n\nNovember 11, 1974, the Property was located in the Borough's single-family\n\nresidential zone.    In 1986, the Borough issued a certificate of continued\n\noccupancy for the Property to \"538 Corp.\" for the \"specific use\" of \"storage of\n\nbusiness trucks.\"\n\n      In 1998, Landover Cooling Tower Service, Inc. (Landover) sought\n\npermission to locate its cooling tower inspection and maintenance business at\n\n\n                                                                           A-3086-23\n                                       3\n\fthe Property.     Landover submitted a proposal to the Borough in which it\n\nproposed to use the property as follows: (1) \"[p]arking for four company trucks\n\n([i]nside of the building)\"; (2) \"[p]arking for two small trailers ([e]ach trailer is\n\n5x16      enclosed     trailer)\";   (3)     \"[d]aytime   [e]mployee    parking\";      (4)\n\n\"[a]dministrative [o]ffice inside [one-third] of the building\"; (5) \"[w]orking\n\nhours will be normal day[-]time working hours 8:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m.\"; and (6)\n\n\"[n]umber of employees[:] six.\" On September 14, 1998, the Borough Zoning\n\nOfficer      advised    Landover      she     \"conducted   extensive    research       on\n\nthe . . . [P]roperty and [found] that [Landover] may locate [its] business there in\n\naccordance with the\" proposal.\n\n       On May 25, 2004, Landover, then known as Mainsail Corporation\n\n(Mainsail), applied to the Board for a use variance to expand the preexisting\n\ncommercial non-conforming use of the Property. Mainsail stated \"[t]he property\n\nis presently used as the warehouse and office of the property owner [.] . . . The\n\npresent interior is used for office and storage. The exterior is for parking and\n\nequipment.\" Before the Board, Mainsail stated it had \"six employees, three\n\ntrucks, and the hours of operation were 7:00 [a.m.] to 5:30 [p.m.] Monday-\n\nFriday[.]\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   A-3086-23\n                                              4\n\f      On July 14, 2004, the Board adopted a resolution (the 2004 Resolution),\n\n\"permit[ting] the demolition and reconstruction of the commercial structure\"\n\nsituated on the Property, subject to the following conditions:\n\n            (1) Hours of operation shall not exceed 7:00 a.m. to\n            7:00 [p.m.] Monday to Saturday; there shall be no\n            operation on Sunday;\n\n            (2) All construction shall meet applicable building\n            codes and sub-codes;\n\n            (3) There shall be no cleaning or maintenance of\n            vehicles performed on-site;\n\n            (4) The design/specifications of the garage doors shall\n            be subject to the approval of [the Zoning Code\n            Officer][;]\n\n            (5) No fabrication, manufacturing, or sales shall be\n            conducted on-site[;]\n\n            (6) The permitted use of property shall be limited to\n            being a base for off-site servicing and maintenance[;]\n            [and]\n\n            (7) The driveway shall be Belgian-Blocked from the\n            street up to the gate, subject to the approval of [the]\n            Planner [][.]\n\nMainsail did not demolish and reconstruct the commercial building on the\n\nProperty as permitted by the 2004 Resolution, and the resolution was abandoned.\n\n      In May 2016, Sitescapes began operations at the Property as a tenant. On\n\nMarch 13, 2018, Sitescapes submitted a \"zoning request/questions\" form to the\n\n                                                                         A-3086-23\n                                        5\n\fBorough, stating it was \"currently purchasing [the Property]. [Sitescapes] would\n\nlike to request usage of the Property for [its] construction company.\"\n\n      On April 19, 2018, the Zoning Code Officer, Victor Vinegra, issued a\n\nzoning certificate for the Property approving Sitescapes' request to \"purchase\n\n[the] building, continue non[-]conforming use, owner occupy for use of yard\n\n[and] office.\" According to Vinegra, he\n\n            reviewed the \"Preliminary Assessment Report\"\n            performed by Peak Environmental, Inc. [(Peak\n            Environmental)] and dated September 1998. This\n            document[] was prepared as part of a submittal to [the\n            New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]\n            concerning the uses of the [P]roperty in reference to\n            environmental concerns.           Peak Environmental\n            researched the previous uses at [the Property] over the\n            last forty plus years. The uses on the referenced site\n            since at least 1970 include the following:\n\n                  1. Industrial Fabrication.\n\n                  2. Masonry and heavy construction.\n\n                  3. Roofing.\n\n                  4. Landscaping.\n\n            Site[s]capes is seeking to continue with the\n            pre[]existing       non-conforming       uses      of\n            landscaping/masonry contractor. It is my professional\n            opinion that Site[s]capes can occupy the site and\n            qualifies as a \"pre[]existing\" non-conforming use and\n            does NOT have to come before the Borough's Zoning\n            Board for approval of occupancy.\n\n                                                                          A-3086-23\n                                       6\n\f      On June 28, 2018, Mainsail sold the Property to 680 Myrtle Avenue LLC\n\n(680 Myrtle), an entity that shares common ownership with Sitescapes. 680\n\nMyrtle then leased the property to Sitescapes.\n\n      On November 14, 2018, plaintiffs, through counsel, wrote to Vinegra,\n\nasking whether \"Sitescape[s] s[ought] use variance relief and if not by what\n\nauthority [is it] operating what is a different non-conforming use\" than permitted\n\nby the 2004 Resolution. Plaintiffs asserted Sitescapes \"has consistently violated\n\nseveral of the conditions\" of the 2004 Resolution and \"[t]he violations are so\n\nextensive that the operation is not merely an intensification of the prior use but\n\nindeed a completely different use.\" They made \"a formal request that [Vinegra]\n\ninvestigate [Sitescapes'] failure to comply with the 2004 [R]esolution.\"\n\n      Plaintiffs specifically alleged the following violations:\n\n            Resolution Condition #1 . . . restricted hours of\n            operation [from] 7:00 a[.]m[.] to 7:00 p[.]m. Trucks\n            have been continuously observed coming to the\n            property at 6:00 a.m. on a daily business and often\n            leaving at 11:00 p.m. Operations are occurring on\n            Sunday, contrary to the [2004 R]esolution.\n\n             ....\n\n            Resolution Condition #3 . . . is also being violated in\n            that [Sitescapes] has often been seen using a power\n            washer machine to clean the trucks[,] even on Sundays.\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-3086-23\n                                        7\n\f             Resolution Condition #5 prohibits fabrication,\n             manufacturing[,] and sales conducted from the site.\n             Although there is no fabrication or manufacturing, the\n             applicant is storing large amounts of construction\n             material on the premises. This is clearly in violation of\n             the spirit of the condition. Indeed[,] it is also a\n             violation of Condition #6, which states that the property\n             shall be limited to off-site servicing and maintenance of\n             vehicles.\n\n        On December 5, 2019, plaintiffs again wrote to Vinegra claiming\n\n\"commercial operations currently taking place at the [P]roperty . . . are not\n\nprotected nor 'grandfathered' as a legally valid, pre[]existing, non[-]conforming\n\nuse.\"\n\n        They alleged\n\n             Site[s]capes has been utilizing the Property well\n             beyond the limited commercial activities at the\n             Property conducted and permitted prior to Mainsail's\n             2004 application \u2013 namely, as specifically approved\n             by the [Garwood] Zoning Officer . . . on September 14,\n             1998[,] which provided that Landover may locate its\n             business at the Property in accordance with its outline\n             of proposed use provided to the Zoning Officer on\n             September 9, 1998.\n\n              ....\n\n                   The actions of Site[s]capes are not remotely\n             \"substantially similar\" to the use that existed at the\n             Property at the time of the adoption of the zoning\n             ordinance placing the Property in a residential zone.\n             Site[s]capes is operating its construction business at the\n             Property in a manner that goes well beyond what is\n\n                                                                           A-3086-23\n                                         8\n\f            permitted[.] . . . It is abundantly clear . . . that any\n            pre[]existing non-conforming use of the Property has\n            been substantially \"enlarged, extended[,] [and]\n            substituted\" in violation of the Garwood Zoning\n            Ordinance, the Municipal Land Use Law, and\n            applicable law.\n\n      Plaintiffs requested \"that [Vinegra], as the Zoning Officer and\n\nAdministrative Officer, confirm to [them] in writing within the next ten . . . days\n\nthat Site[s]capes must immediately cease its expanded operations . . . and\n\ninstead conform to the legally permitted limits for any commercial use of the\n\nProperty as a pre[]existing, non-conforming use as confirmed by the Garwood\n\nZoning Officer in 1998.\" On January 7, 2020, plaintiffs again wrote to Vinegra,\n\nrequesting confirmation \"in writing that . . . Site[s]capes immediately cease its\n\nexpanded operations and instead conform to the legally permitted limits for any\n\ncommercial use of the Property . . . confirmed by the [Borough] Zoning Officer\n\nin 1998.\"\n\n      On January 23, 2020, plaintiffs filed an \"appeal and application for\n\ninterpretation of ordinance\" with the Board \"concerning the failure\n\nof . . . Vinegra . . . to provide confirmation that the nature and intensity of the\n\nuse of the [P]roperty . . . has changed and expanded well beyond that in effect\n\nat the time the Property became non[-]conforming.\" \"As no response was ever\n\nreceived [to their December 5, 2019, and January 7, 2020] letter[s]\" plaintiffs\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                        9\n\fsubmitted their appeal and application for interpretation \"as to whether\n\nSite[s]capes' use of the Property . . . has improperly expanded beyond the\n\n'grandfathered' conditions.\" The Board scheduled a hearing for July 22, 2020.\n\n      In a July 17, 2020 letter to the Board, Vinegra stated he\n\n            was in contact with [plaintiffs] back in 2019. . . . [He]\n            had numerous conversations with [plaintiffs' former\n            attorney] to discuss [plaintiffs'] concerns. In 2019, [he]\n            had numerous conversations with [plaintiffs' counsel]\n            to discuss his clients' concerns. Somewhere in the\n            summer of 2019[, he] met with [plaintiffs] at [their]\n            home next door to [the Property]. [His]\n            determination . . . [was] that the existing use by\n            Site[s]capes was a pre[]existing non-conforming use\n            and that the restrictions [plaintiffs] wanted [to]\n            enforce[] were not applicable. He notified [plaintiffs'\n            counsel] and [plaintiffs] of [his] findings.\n\n      After Vinegra advised plaintiffs that Sitescapes' \"use was consistent with\n\nthe prior uses which utilized the site in the past[,]\" plaintiffs' counsel \"did not\n\npursue any additional determinations after [their] on-site meeting.\" Based on\n\nhis review of the historical uses of the property, Vinegra advised the Board\n\n\"Site[s]capes . . . is a landscaping/mason/general site contractor which is NOT\n\nsubstantially different from the previous uses since 1970.\" His \"professional\n\nopinion\" as the Zoning Officer was that \"Site[s]capes compli[ed] with the\n\nprovisions as a 'construction contractors' yard' and is a pre[]existing non-\n\nconforming use. Thus, they are operating legally as far as zoning regulations.\"\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                       10\n\f      On July 22, 2020, plaintiffs' attorney wrote to the Board claiming\n\nVinegra's July 17, 2020 correspondence \"constitute[s] 'a decision or refusal\n\nmade by an administrative officer based on or made in the enforcement of the\n\nzoning ordinance,' contemplated by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(a).\"               Plaintiffs\n\nrequested the hearing on their appeal be adjourned to August 26, 2020. It was\n\nsubsequently rescheduled for September 30, 2020.\n\n      On September 30, 2020, Donald Fraser, Esq., the Board's attorney,\n\nadvised the Board that \"before [it] can, or should, reach the question of whether\n\nor not the activities of [Sitescapes] are in compliance with the applicable\n\n[z]oning [o]rdinance, and/or any prior approvals granted by the Board and/or\n\nany municipal official, the Board must first address the question of whether it\n\nhas jurisdiction to consider the matter, and/or to grant whatever relief may be\n\nsought.\"\n\n      Fraser concluded plaintiffs' appeal \"is a matter for the courts, and not for\n\nthe . . . Board     to     decide.\"             He       concluded       plaintiffs\n\n\"[f]undamentally . . . seek[] . . . to enforce the zoning ordinance against\n\n[Sitescapes], contending that the activities taking place at [the Property] violate\n\nthe zoning ordinance.\" According to Fraser,\n\n             The [Board] is not the entity charged with enforcement.\n             If the [plaintiffs] believe that the Zoning Officer is\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                       11\n\f            improperly failing to discharge his duties, the\n            [plaintiffs] could either file a citizen's complaint in\n            [m]unicipal [c]ourt. . . . [or] the [plaintiffs] could file in\n            Superior Court, and seek either injunctive relief against\n            [Sitescapes], and/or a mandamus compelling the\n            Zoning Officer to act.\n\n      In addition, Fraser advised the Board that plaintiffs' \"appeal [was]\n\nuntimely\" because it was filed more than twenty days after the Zoning Officer's\n\ndecision, in violation of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-72. Specifically, Vinegra \"met with\n\n[plaintiffs and their attorney] in the summer of 2019. Whether or not [plaintiffs]\n\nwere aware of [Vinegra's] decision prior to the time of the meeting in the\n\nsummer of 2019, they clearly were aware of it by then. Hence, the [twenty] days\n\nexpired long before the submission of [plaintiffs'] present appeal.\" Lastly,\n\nFraser did \"not see a basis for [plaintiffs'] request for interpretation under\n\nN.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(b)\" because \"[t]hat subsection . . . relates to interpretation\n\nof 'the zoning map or ordinance,' which is not at issue in this case.\"\n\n      On September 30, 2020, the Board considered plaintiffs' appeal and\n\napplication at a public meeting. Plaintiffs' counsel appeared at the hearing and\n\nargued in opposition to the denial of the appeal and application. On October 14,\n\n2020, the Borough adopted a resolution denying plaintiffs' January 23, 2020\n\nappeal and application, based on \"the reasons set forth in [Fraser's] September\n\n30, 2020 [o]pinion [l]etter.\"\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                        12\n\f      In a letter dated October 19, 2020, Vinegra advised Sitescapes he\n\n\"[o]riginally . . . issued a letter permitting the continuance of a landscaping\n\ncompany\"     and   \"[s]ince   the   April   18,   2018   letter,   [he]   believe[d]\n\n[Sitescapes] . . . expanded into the heavy excavating/trucking business[,] which\n\nis not landscaping.\"       He demanded Sitescapes correct the violations\n\nimmediately.\n\n      On October 20, 2020, the Borough Zoning Enforcement Officer issued a\n\nviolation notice to Sitescapes for (1) \"expansion of non-conforming use \u2013\n\ntandem dump trucks;\" (2) \"dumpster in front yard, unscreened;\" and (3) \"high\n\nintensity lighting not shielded.\" On November 2, 2020, the Zoning Enforcement\n\nOfficer issued a violation notice update stating, \"[t]he condition [was] corrected\n\nsatisfactorily.\"\n\n      On November 28, 2020, plaintiffs filed an action \"in [l]ieu of [p]rerogative\n\n[w]rits and for other relief\" against the Borough Defendants and Sitescapes. On\n\nOctober 18, 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. As to the Borough\n\nDefendants, plaintiffs alleged: (1) improperly expanded non-conforming use of\n\nthe Property (count one); (2) the Borough is required to enforce its own\n\nordinances under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-18 (count two); (3) the Board declining to\n\nrule on their appeal and application was improper (count three); (4) civil action\n\n\n                                                                              A-3086-23\n                                       13\n\ffor deprivation of rights (count four); and (5) writ of mandamus (count five).\n\nAs against all defendants, plaintiffs alleged: (1) public nuisance on land harming\n\nneighbors (count six); and (2) private nuisance (count seven).\n\n      At his deposition, Vinegra testified Sitescapes' use of the Property is a\n\n\"preexisting non[-]conformity of a construction yard.\"        He confirmed five\n\nentities owned the Property prior to 2018 based on information \"from an\n\nenvironmental report\" prepared by Peak Environmental in September 1998.\n\nAccording to that report, all five prior owners used the Property as a construction\n\nyard. \"Outside of the report by Peak Environmental and [his] follow-up as to\n\ndates of ownership with previous owners,\" he \"look[ed] at historical\n\nphotographs in Google Earth\" to confirm Sitescapes' use of the Property was a\n\npreexisting non-conforming use.\n\n      Vinegra \"investigated the [P]roperty\" and observed \"rear yard storage\"\n\nand \"some side yard storage\" for \"[c]onstruction material.\"             He \"took\n\nphotographs\" which depicted \"four-by-four posts,\" \"concrete block,\" and\n\n\"storage racks.\"     He saw \"the same storage . . . in previous historical\n\nphotographs.\" According to Vinegra, Landover also \"had construction material,\n\nand they had racks of scaffolding, those types of things.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                       14\n\f      At his deposition, Morocho testified he was aware the Property was a\n\ncommercial property when he purchased his adjoining property in 2015. When\n\nSitescapes arrived in 2016, he \"started to see a lot of activity, because the trucks\n\nthat they own . . . [are] . . . big industrial-grade trucks, and . . . there was a lot\n\nof noise that was produced by these trucks, back-up alarms.\" He recalled\n\nSitescapes applied for \"a zoning permit to put a fence . . . right into the property\n\nline,\" which \"basically . . . remove[d] the buffer area\" between his property and\n\nthe Property.\n\n      Morocho could not recall if Vinegra told him directly in 2019 that\n\nSitescapes' use of the Property was a preexisting non-conforming use. However,\n\nhe admitted he received an email from Vinegra stating Sitescapes was operating\n\nlawfully. He agreed the historical research performed by Peak Environmental\n\nshowing the Property's previous uses from 1974 to 2020 was accurate, but\n\nclaimed Landover's use was not \"construction\" and \"iron workers.\"\n\n      He testified Sitescapes' use of the Property was a nuisance because \"the\n\ndump trucks [it] uses are large, commercial trucks.            The noise that they\n\ncreate . . . [is] very loud.   They[ are] diesel-engine trucks, 40,000-pounds\n\ncapacity trucks. They are equipped with back-up alarms. The noise . . . far\n\nexceeds . . . normal decibel levels for a residential neighborhood.\" \"And also\n\n\n                                                                               A-3086-23\n                                         15\n\fthe use of power washing machines, power washing [its] equipment all the\n\ntime. . . . create[s] a tremendous noise. . . . [The] trucks coming into the\n\n[P]roperty fully loaded . . . shakes [plaintiffs' house] when they come in.\"\n\nMorocho conceded he \"does[ not] have a specific decibel reading\" of the trucks.\n\n      Morocho testified he filed the appeal with the Board because he \"want[ed]\n\nan interpretation from the [Board] to tell [him] if . . . the resolution is valid, or\n\nit[ is] not valid. And . . . [he] think[s] that[ is] when the [B]oard failed to just\n\nto listen to [him] . . . and tell [him], . . . [whether] the resolution is valid, or it[\n\nis] invalid.\"     He conceded he is \"essentially . . . appealing [Vinegra's]\n\ndetermination that [Sitescapes' use] is a non[-]conforming preexisting use\"\n\nbecause it \"had to go before the [B]oard and explain on paper what\n\nexact[] . . . type of business they were going to be running from the site.\" Thus,\n\nMorocho's \"two goals [with his appeal was an] interpretation of the 2004\n\n[R]esolution and to overturn the decision . . . Vinegra made that Site[s]capes is\n\nnot in violation and operating lawfully as a non[-]conforming preexisting use.\"\n\n      Jeffrey Gabriel, the owner of Sitescapes, testified that the \"Union County\n\nBoard of Health\" conducted a \"noise visit\" at the Property.              \"They tested\n\n[Sitescapes'] . . . vehicles and machinery in [their] daily operations\" and\n\n\"[s]pent a few hours at the [P]roperty and they passed.\"\n\n\n                                                                                 A-3086-23\n                                          16\n\f                                        II.\n\n      After the completion of discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment.         On April 19, 2024, the judge heard oral argument.\n\nPlaintiffs' counsel argued \"[t]he real question here . . . is whether or not the\n\ncontinued use of this [P]roperty . . . exceeds its use as it was prior to the\n\nordinance making it a non-permitted use.\"        \"Plaintiffs are challenging the\n\nintensity of the use of the [P]roperty and whether or not it exceeds the\n\npreexisting use that it is.\" He conceded the zoning officer determined \"in 2018,\n\nthat this [P]roperty is a preexisting non-conforming use.\"\n\n      On April 23, the judge entered orders denying plaintiffs' motion and\n\ngranting defendants' motions, supported by a written opinion.          The judge\n\ndismissed counts six, alleging public nuisance, and seven, alleging private\n\nnuisance, against the Borough Defendants because plaintiffs failed to serve a\n\ntimely notice of tort claim as required by the New Jersey Tort Claims Act (TCA),\n\nN.J.S.A. 59:8-1 to -11.\n\n      The judge determined count two alleging \"failure to enforce an ordinance\n\nin violation of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-18,\" was precluded by N.J.S.A. 59:2-4, which\n\nprovides \"[a] public entity is not liable for any injury caused by . . . failing to\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                       17\n\fenforce any law.\" She also found, \"the record [was] devoid of information\n\nestablishing that the [Borough] [D]efendants failed to enforce\" an ordinance.\n\n      The judge dismissed counts one, alleging Sitescapes improperly expanded\n\nthe non-conforming use of the property; three, alleging that the Board\n\nimproperly declined to rule on plaintiffs' appeal and application; and five,\n\nseeking a writ of mandamus, because plaintiffs failed to file their action in lieu\n\nof prerogative writs within forty-five \"days after the accrual of the right to\n\nreview, hearing[,] or relief claimed\" as required by Rule 4:69-6(a). She rejected\n\nplaintiffs' contention that the forty-five-day time bar should be relaxed pursuant\n\nto Rule 4:69-6(c). The judge found the case did not involve \"an important and\n\nnovel constitutional question; ex parte determination of [a] legal question by\n\nadministrative officials; or important public rather than private interests.\"\n\n      The judge nevertheless addressed the merits of plaintiffs' claims and\n\ndetermined \"Site[s]capes use of the Property is not an improper expansion of a\n\nnon-conforming use.\"      She found \"Vinegra did a proper investigation into\n\ndetermining whether . . . Site[s]capes use of the Property was a conforming\n\nuse.\" The judge determined\n\n            Vinegra relied on the [Peak Environmental] [r]eport in\n            which the authors . . . obtained land use records from\n            the [Borough]. Within the records, it stated that the\n            prior     uses      of       the     Property     were\n\n                                                                                A-3086-23\n                                       18\n\f            landscaping/construction            yard;       construction\n            yard/mason; construction yard/roofing; construction\n            yard/street sweeping; construction yard/iron workers;\n            and              construction               yard/landscaper.\n            Additionally, . . . Vinegra        reviewed        historical\n            photographs to see what was stored on the Property in\n            the past and how the previous owners used it; visited\n            the Property to observe . . . Site[s]capes' use of the\n            Property; and spoke with the prior owners on the\n            previous use of the Property. [Borough] Ordinance\n            106-123 states that business hours must be closed\n            between 12:00 [a.m.] and 5:00 [a.m.], here plaintiffs\n            argue that . . . Site[s]capes start[s] to use the Property\n            at 5:30 [a.m.]. . . . Site[s]capes' use of the Property does\n            not violate the Ordinance.\n\nThe judge concluded \"the record is devoid of any information showing\n\nthat . . . Site[s]capes['] use of the Property is substantially different than the\n\nprior uses of the Property.\"\n\n      The judge also dismissed count four, alleging a violation of the New\n\nJersey Civil Rights Act (CRA), N.J.S.A. 10:6-1 to -2, because plaintiffs did \"not\n\nprovide[] sufficient evidence to show that their substantive rights were\n\nviolated.\" She found \"[t]here has been no evidence provided that shows that\n\n[the Borough Defendants] declined to hear plaintiffs' application because of\n\ntheir race, national origin, age, and disability.\" The judge did \"not find that the\n\n[Borough] [D]efendants' actions 'shock the conscience.'\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                        19\n\f      The judge concluded plaintiffs' reliance on Harz v. Borough of Spring\n\nLake, 234 N.J. 317 (2018), was misplaced because in that case \"the plaintiff\n\ntimely filed an application to appeal the issuance of the zoning permit, while in\n\nthis matter plaintiffs failed to timely file an appeal.\" In addition, the Board\n\n            did not simply decline to hear plaintiffs' application\n            without conducting a hearing; rather, they provided\n            [plaintiffs' attorney] an opportunity to speak in front of\n            the Board and argue why plaintiffs' application should\n            be heard. Additionally, [plaintiffs' attorney] was able\n            to rebut comments and questions made by the Board.\n\n      The judge rejected plaintiffs' claim that the Borough's October 14, 2020\n\nresolution denying their appeal and application was arbitrary, capricious, or\n\nunreasonable.   She found the Board correctly determined plaintiffs' appeal\n\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(a) was untimely because it was not filed within\n\ntwenty days of Vinegra's determination that Sitescapes did not substantially\n\nchange or expand the non-conforming use of the Property.\n\n      Specifically, the judge found \"[u]nder N.J.S.A. 40:55D-72, appeals to the\n\n[B]oard may be taken by an interested party who is affected by a decision of an\n\nadministrative officer within twenty days of the decision\" and \"the time for\n\nnotice of the appeal begins to run when the interested party knew or should have\n\nknown\" of the decision. The judge determined Vinegra \"had an on-site meeting\n\nwith plaintiffs' former counsel in the summer of 2019 and informed\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                       20\n\fboth . . . Morocho and his counsel of . . . Vinegra's findings\" and \"had numerous\n\nconversations with . . . Morocho and counsel . . . about . . . Morocho's concerns\n\nin 2019.\" Based on that, the judge found \"plaintiffs either knew or should have\n\nknown of the pre[]existing non[-]conforming use [decision] issued to []\n\nSite[s]capes between late 2018 and early 2019\" and their \"appeal in January\n\n2020 was well past the deadline to appeal pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-72.\"\n\n      The judge rejected plaintiffs' claim that their application sought the\n\ninterpretation of a zoning map or ordinance pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(b).\n\nShe found \"[t]he letters sent on December 5, 2019 and January 7, 2020, d[id]\n\nnot request [the] interpretation of [an] [o]rdinance.\" She found \"[t]he record is\n\nclear that plaintiff[s] [were] appealing the determination that . . . Site[s]capes\n\nuse of the Property was a nonconforming use.\" \"Absent from these letters is\n\nplaintiffs' request for an interpretation\" of a zoning map or ordinance.\n\n      The judge determined \"plaintiffs are unable to establish that the Board\n\nacted in an arbitrary and capricious fashion by not hearing [their]\" appeal and\n\napplication. \"There [was] sufficient evidence that establishes that the Board's\n\ndecision to deny plaintiff's [appeal and] application was based on due\n\nconsideration.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-3086-23\n                                       21\n\f      The judge rejected plaintiffs' demand for a writ of mandamus because\n\n\"plaintiff[s] . . . failed to establish that there was a clear violation of [a Borough]\n\n[o]rdinance and a failure to take action by the [Borough] [D]efendants.\"\n\n      The judge determined plaintiffs' public and private nuisance claims\n\nagainst the Borough Defendants failed as a matter of law because there \"has\n\nbeen no allegations asserted against the [Borough] [D]efendants that they own\n\nthe . . . [P]roperty\" and \"plaintiff[s] . . . failed to properly file a notice of tort\n\nclaim.\" She also determined plaintiffs' public nuisance claim failed against all\n\ndefendants because plaintiffs \"have not provided any evidence showing that\n\nplaintiffs are suffering a harm different from that suffered by other members of\n\nthe public.\"\n\n      Finally,     the   judge    determined     plaintiffs   \"failed   to   establish\n\nthat . . . Site[s]capes['] use of the Property constitute[s] a private nuisance.\" She\n\nfound:\n\n               the record is devoid of any information establishing the\n               dates and times when the alleged nuisance would occur\n               or the frequency [or] magnitude of the alleged nuisance.\n               Plaintiffs        have         provided        photographs\n               of . . . Site[s]capes' use of the [P]roperty, which depicts\n               the trucks and storage on the Property; however [the]\n               photographs have not been authenticated by plaintiffs.\n               Plaintiffs have complained that the noise of the trucks\n               [is] loud; however, plaintiffs have provided no decibel\n               reading as to the noise[.] . . . Conversely, [Sitescapes'\n\n                                                                                A-3086-23\n                                          22\n\f            representative] testified that the Union County Board of\n            Health tested the noise levels on the Property\n            and . . . Site[s]capes passed.       The only evidence\n            plaintiffs have presented . . . regarding their private\n            nuisance claim is . . . Morocho's own complaints;\n            however, without any evidence to support such\n            complaints, no reasonable fact finder can conclude\n            that . . . Site[s]capes' use of the Property constituted a\n            private nuisance.\n\n\n                                       III.\n\n      On appeal, plaintiffs argue they \"have standing to bring this suit.\"\n\nSpecifically, they contend their claim pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-18 is not an\n\n\"action in lieu of prerogative writs tried on the record below\" or \"a demand for\n\ndamages under the\" TCA. They argue the judge improperly dismissed their\n\nprivate nuisance claim because it \"was not against a public entity.\" Plaintiffs\n\ncontend their nuisance claim is subject to the \"continuing tort doctrine\" and the\n\njudge \"erroneously dismissed [their] claims 'with prejudice' without addressing\n\nthe date [on] which the statute of limitations commenced.\"\n\n      Plaintiffs argue the judge improperly determined their action in lieu of\n\nprerogative writs was untimely because they \"challenge the present use of the\n\nProperty, and whether or not it has been illegally intensified since the Zoning\n\nOfficer's issuance of the 2018 Zoning Certificate/Permit.\" In the alternative,\n\nthey argue the judge \"should have granted [plaintiffs] an enlargement of time\"\n\n                                                                           A-3086-23\n                                       23\n\fpursuant to Rule 4:69-6(c) \"to determine whether there was an incorrect and/or\n\nillegal administrative determination of a zoning officer without a proper\n\ninvestigation into the preexisting non[-]conforming use.\"          They also argue\n\n\"[m]uch like the 'continuing tort doctrine[,]' the need to determine actual dates\n\nof actionable claims renders any decision by the [judge] as to the applicability\n\nof [the] statute of limitations moot.\"\n\n      Plaintiffs next contend the Board's October 14, 2020 resolution was\n\narbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable because they \"were not challenging the\n\n2018 or 2019 'determinations' of the Zoning Officer.\"            Rather, they \"were\n\nchallenging the inaction of the Zoning Officer\" and the \"Board failed to grasp\n\nwhat exactly was being appealed.\" Plaintiffs argue the judge \"[w]rongfully\n\n[d]etermined Site[s]capes . . .

Like the trial\n\ncourt, we consider \"whether the competent evidential materials presented, when\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, are sufficient to\n\npermit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the\n\nnon-moving party.\" Brill, 142 N.J. at 540. \"By its plain language, Rule 4:46-2\n\ndictates that a court should deny a summary judgment motion only where [a]\n\nparty opposing the motion has come forward with evidence that creates a\n\n'genuine issue as to any material fact challenged.'\"       Id. at 529 (emphasis\n\nomitted).\n\n      Based on our de novo review, we are convinced the judge properly denied\n\nplaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted defendants' motions. The\n\njudge correctly determined plaintiffs' action in lieu of prerogative writs was not\n\n\n                                                                            A-3086-23\n                                       25\n\ftimely filed. Rule 4:69-6(a) provides \"[n]o action in lieu of prerogative writs\n\nshall be commenced later than [forty-five] days after the accrual of the right to\n\nthe review, hearing[,] or relief claimed.\" The Rule allows for the enlargement\n\nof the period of time provided in paragraph (a) \"where it is manifest that the\n\ninterest of justice so requires.\" R. 4:69-6(c). Such an extension is appropriate\n\nonly if the court finds: \"(1) important and novel constitutional questions; (2)\n\ninformal or ex parte determinations of legal questions by administrative\n\nofficials; and (3) important public rather than private interests which require\n\nadjudication or clarification.\"   Reilly v. Brice, 109 N.J. 555, 558 (1988)\n\n(emphasis omitted).\n\n        Plaintiffs' claims in counts one, three, and five challenge the Borough\n\nDefendant's April 19, 2018 determination that Sitescapes' use of the Property\n\nwas permitted as a preexisting non-conforming use. As the judge properly\n\ndetermined, plaintiffs were aware of that decision at least as early as 2019 when\n\nVinegra met with Morocho and his prior counsel. Plaintiffs action in lieu of\n\nprerogative writs was filed on November 28, 2020, long after the expiration of\n\nthe forty-five-day limitations period. We are satisfied the judge appropriately\n\nexercised her discretion to decline to extend that period under the facts of this\n\ncase.\n\n\n                                                                           A-3086-23\n                                      26\n\f      The judge correctly dismissed the public and private nuisance claims\n\nagainst the Borough Defendants for failure to file a timely notice of tort claim.\n\nTort claims, including nuisance claims, against public entities are governed by\n\nthe TCA. Posey v. Bordentown Sewerage Auth., 171 N.J. 172, 181 (2002). A\n\nparty has ninety days from the accrual of a claim to file notice of a claim against\n\na public entity. N.J.S.A. 59:8-8(a). Here, plaintiffs were aware of the alleged\n\nnuisance at the Property no later than 2019. They never served a notice of tort\n\nclaim as required by the TCA. Accordingly, their purported nuisance claims\n\nagainst the Borough Defendants are precluded.\n\n      We are convinced the judge properly dismissed count two of plaintiffs'\n\namended complaint alleging the Borough Defendants \"failed to enforce\" a\n\nBorough ordinance \"under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-18.\" That statute provides that a\n\n\"governing body of a municipality shall enforce . . . any ordinance\" if \"any\n\nbuilding, structure[,]or land is used in violation of . . . any ordinance.\" N.J.S.A.\n\n40:55D-18. Here, plaintiffs contend the Borough Defendants failed to enforce\n\nBorough Ordinance \u00a7 106-122(B) (the Ordinance), which provides \"[n]o\n\nexisting use, structure[,] or premises devoted to a non[-]conforming use shall be\n\nenlarged, extended, reconstructed, substituted[,] or structurally altered, unless it\n\nis changed to a conforming use.\"\n\n\n                                                                              A-3086-23\n                                        27\n\f      We are persuaded the judge correctly determined the Borough Defendants\n\nhave not failed to enforce the Ordinance. Rather, the Borough Defendants\n\ndetermined that Sitescapes' use of the Property is a permitted non-conforming\n\nuse and Sitescapes is not violating the Ordinance. Plaintiffs' claim is based not\n\non the Borough Defendants' failure to enforce the Ordinance, but on their\n\ndisagreement with the Borough Defendants' determination regarding Sitescapes'\n\nuse of the Property. The Borough Defendants are enforcing the Ordinance; they\n\nare just not enforcing it the way plaintiffs want them to.\n\n      Plaintiffs' claims under the CRA lack merit for the same reasons. The\n\njudge properly concluded the Borough Defendants have not deprived plaintiffs\n\nof a substantive right. There is no basis to find they \"intentionally\" failed to\n\n\"exercise proper oversight over the Property\" or \"enforce [the] Ordinance.\"\n\nPlaintiffs' claim that the Board failed to hear their appeal and application is\n\nincorrect. The Board heard the matter at a public meeting and determined the\n\nappeal was untimely and the \"application\" for an interpretation of a \"zoning map\n\nor ordinance\" lacked merit.\n\n      We are satisfied the judge correctly determined the Board's October 14,\n\n2020 resolution denying plaintiffs' appeal and application was not arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or unreasonable. When considering an appeal from an action taken\n\n\n                                                                           A-3086-23\n                                       28\n\fby a planning board, a reviewing court must determine whether the board's\n\ndecision was \"arbitrary, capricious[,] or unreasonable.\" Fallone Props., L.L.C.\n\nv.

The purpose of the time limit is to \"insulate the recipient of a building permit\n\nor other favorable disposition from the threat of unrestrained future challenge.\n\nIt was intended to provide a degree of assurance that the recipient could rely on\n\nthe decision of the administrative officer.\" Ibid.\n\n      As the judge found, the Board's decision to deny plaintiffs' appeal\n\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(a) as untimely was amply supported by the\n\nrecord. Plaintiffs were aware of Vinegra's decision in 2019 at the latest and did\n\nnot file their appeal until January 23, 2020, long after the twenty-day period\n\nprescribed by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-72. The Board's decision to deny plaintiffs'\n\napplication for an \"interpretation\" was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable\n\nbecause plaintiffs did not request an interpretation of a \"zoning map or\n\nordinance.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              A-3086-23\n                                        30\n\f      We are satisfied the judge correctly granted Sitescapes' motion for\n\nsummary judgment on plaintiffs' private nuisance claim. 1 \"The essence of a\n\nprivate nuisance is an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of\n\nland.\" Sans v. Ramsey Golf & Country Club, Inc., 29 N.J. 438, 448 (1959). In\n\nevaluating whether there is a private nuisance, the court must weigh \"[t]he utility\n\nof the defendant's conduct . . . against the quantum of harm to the plaintiff\" in\n\norder to determine \"whether the annoyance or disturbance arises from an\n\nunreasonable use of the neighbor's land or operation of [their] business.\" Id. at\n\n449 (emphasis omitted).     \"The question is not simply whether a person is\n\nannoyed or disturbed, but whether the annoyance or disturbance arises from an\n\nunreasonable use of the neighbor's land or . . . business.\" Ibid.\n\n      Here, the judge found plaintiffs failed to set forth evidence sufficient for\n\na reasonable jury to find Sitescapes created a private nuisance. Plaintiffs did\n\nnot present any expert testimony or other competent evidence to establish the\n\nnoise levels at the Property and did not demonstrate Sitescapes was violating\n\nany noise ordinance or ordinance establishing the permitted hours of operation.\n\n\n1\n   Plaintiffs do not address their claim in count six that defendants created a\n\"public nuisance.\" If an issue is not briefed, it is deemed waived. State v.\nHuang, 461 N.J. Super. 119, 125 (App. Div. 2018); see also Pressler &\nVerniero, Current N.J. Court Rules, cmt. 5 on R. 2:6-2 (2025) (\"It is, of course,\nclear that an issue not briefed is deemed waived.\").\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                       31\n\f      Moreover, the Borough Defendants determined Sitescapes is properly\n\noperating as a commercial, non-conforming permitted use on the Property. As\n\nthe judge found, plaintiffs' private nuisance claim was based on their subjective\n\ncomplaints about Sitescapes' permitted use of the Property. Based on our de\n\nnovo review, we are convinced the judge properly granted Sitescapes' motion\n\nfor summary judgment.\n\n      To the extent we have not specifically addressed any remaining\n\narguments, it is because they lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a\n\nwritten opinion.

Sitescapes owns and operates its\n\nbusinesses at 680 Myrtle Avenue in Garwood (the Property), which is adjacent\n\nto plaintiffs&#x27; property.\n\n      The Property is located within the Borough&#x27;s single-family residential\n\nzone but has been the site of non-conforming commercial operations including\n\nindustrial fabrication, masonry and heavy construction, roofing, and landscaping\n\nsince at least 1970. In 1974, the Property was purchased by M. Hirsch &amp; Sons,\n\nInc. On September 12, 1974, the Borough issued a certificate of occupancy to\n\n&quot;F. Hirsch&quot; to use the Property &quot;for the purposes of a private garage.&quot; Effective\n\nNovember 11, 1974, the Property was located in the Borough&#x27;s single-family\n\nresidential zone.    In 1986, the Borough issued a certificate of continued\n\noccupancy for the Property to &quot;538 Corp.&quot; for the &quot;specific use&quot; of &quot;storage of\n\nbusiness trucks.&quot;\n\n      In 1998, Landover Cooling Tower Service, Inc. (Landover) sought\n\npermission to locate its cooling tower inspection and maintenance business at\n\n\n                                                                           A-3086-23\n                                       3\n\fthe Property.     Landover submitted a proposal to the Borough in which it\n\nproposed to use the property as follows: (1) &quot;[p]arking for four company trucks\n\n([i]nside of the building)&quot;; (2) &quot;[p]arking for two small trailers ([e]ach trailer is\n\n5x16      enclosed     trailer)&quot;;   (3)     &quot;[d]aytime   [e]mployee    parking&quot;;      (4)\n\n&quot;[a]dministrative [o]ffice inside [one-third] of the building&quot;; (5) &quot;[w]orking\n\nhours will be normal day[-]time working hours 8:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m.&quot;; and (6)\n\n&quot;[n]umber of employees[:] six.&quot; On September 14, 1998, the Borough Zoning\n\nOfficer      advised    Landover      she     &quot;conducted   extensive    research       on\n\nthe . . .

[Sitescapes] would\n\nlike to request usage of the Property for [its] construction company.&quot;\n\n      On April 19, 2018, the Zoning Code Officer, Victor Vinegra, issued a\n\nzoning certificate for the Property approving Sitescapes&#x27; request to &quot;purchase\n\n[the] building, continue non[-]conforming use, owner occupy for use of yard\n\n[and] office.&quot; According to Vinegra, he\n\n            reviewed the &quot;Preliminary Assessment Report&quot;\n            performed by Peak Environmental, Inc. [(Peak\n            Environmental)] and dated September 1998. This\n            document[] was prepared as part of a submittal to [the\n            New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]\n            concerning the uses of the [P]roperty in reference to\n            environmental concerns.           Peak Environmental\n            researched the previous uses at [the Property] over the\n            last forty plus years. The uses on the referenced site\n            since at least 1970 include the following:\n\n                  1. Industrial Fabrication.\n\n                  2. Masonry and heavy construction.\n\n                  3. Roofing.\n\n                  4. Landscaping.\n\n            Site[s]capes is seeking to continue with the\n            pre[]existing       non-conforming       uses      of\n            landscaping/masonry contractor. It is my professional\n            opinion that Site[s]capes can occupy the site and\n            qualifies as a &quot;pre[]existing&quot; non-conforming use and\n            does NOT have to come before the Borough&#x27;s Zoning\n            Board for approval of occupancy.\n\n                                                                          A-3086-23\n                                       6\n\f      On June 28, 2018, Mainsail sold the Property to 680 Myrtle Avenue LLC\n\n(680 Myrtle), an entity that shares common ownership with Sitescapes. 680\n\nMyrtle then leased the property to Sitescapes.\n\n      On November 14, 2018, plaintiffs, through counsel, wrote to Vinegra,\n\nasking whether &quot;Sitescape[s] s[ought] use variance relief and if not by what\n\nauthority [is it] operating what is a different non-conforming use&quot; than permitted\n\nby the 2004 Resolution. Plaintiffs asserted Sitescapes &quot;has consistently violated\n\nseveral of the conditions&quot; of the 2004 Resolution and &quot;[t]he violations are so\n\nextensive that the operation is not merely an intensification of the prior use but\n\nindeed a completely different use.&quot; They made &quot;a formal request that [Vinegra]\n\ninvestigate [Sitescapes&#x27;] failure to comply with the 2004 [R]esolution.&quot;\n\n      Plaintiffs specifically alleged the following violations:\n\n            Resolution Condition #1 . . . restricted hours of\n            operation [from] 7:00 a[.]m[.] to 7:00 p[.]m. Trucks\n            have been continuously observed coming to the\n            property at 6:00 a.m. on a daily business and often\n            leaving at 11:00 p.m. Operations are occurring on\n            Sunday, contrary to the [2004 R]esolution.\n\n             ....\n\n            Resolution Condition #3 . . . is also being violated in\n            that [Sitescapes] has often been seen using a power\n            washer machine to clean the trucks[,] even on Sundays.\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-3086-23\n                                        7\n\f             Resolution Condition #5 prohibits fabrication,\n             manufacturing[,] and sales conducted from the site.\n             Although there is no fabrication or manufacturing, the\n             applicant is storing large amounts of construction\n             material on the premises. This is clearly in violation of\n             the spirit of the condition. Indeed[,] it is also a\n             violation of Condition #6, which states that the property\n             shall be limited to off-site servicing and maintenance of\n             vehicles.\n\n        On December 5, 2019, plaintiffs again wrote to Vinegra claiming\n\n&quot;commercial operations currently taking place at the [P]roperty . . . are not\n\nprotected nor &#x27;grandfathered&#x27; as a legally valid, pre[]existing, non[-]conforming\n\nuse.&quot;\n\n        They alleged\n\n             Site[s]capes has been utilizing the Property well\n             beyond the limited commercial activities at the\n             Property conducted and permitted prior to Mainsail&#x27;s\n             2004 application \u2013 namely, as specifically approved\n             by the [Garwood] Zoning Officer . . . on September 14,\n             1998[,] which provided that Landover may locate its\n             business at the Property in accordance with its outline\n             of proposed use provided to the Zoning Officer on\n             September 9, 1998.\n\n              ....\n\n                   The actions of Site[s]capes are not remotely\n             &quot;substantially similar&quot; to the use that existed at the\n             Property at the time of the adoption of the zoning\n             ordinance placing the Property in a residential zone.\n             Site[s]capes is operating its construction business at the\n             Property in a manner that goes well beyond what is\n\n                                                                           A-3086-23\n                                         8\n\f            permitted[.] . . .

Site[s]capes immediately cease its\n\nexpanded operations and instead conform to the legally permitted limits for any\n\ncommercial use of the Property . . . confirmed by the [Borough] Zoning Officer\n\nin 1998.&quot;\n\n      On January 23, 2020, plaintiffs filed an &quot;appeal and application for\n\ninterpretation of ordinance&quot; with the Board &quot;concerning the failure\n\nof . . . Vinegra . . . to provide confirmation that the nature and intensity of the\n\nuse of the [P]roperty . . . has changed and expanded well beyond that in effect\n\nat the time the Property became non[-]conforming.&quot; &quot;As no response was ever\n\nreceived [to their December 5, 2019, and January 7, 2020] letter[s]&quot; plaintiffs\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                        9\n\fsubmitted their appeal and application for interpretation &quot;as to whether\n\nSite[s]capes&#x27; use of the Property . . . has improperly expanded beyond the\n\n&#x27;grandfathered&#x27; conditions.&quot; The Board scheduled a hearing for July 22, 2020.\n\n      In a July 17, 2020 letter to the Board, Vinegra stated he\n\n            was in contact with [plaintiffs] back in 2019. . . . [He]\n            had numerous conversations with [plaintiffs&#x27; former\n            attorney] to discuss [plaintiffs&#x27;] concerns. In 2019, [he]\n            had numerous conversations with [plaintiffs&#x27; counsel]\n            to discuss his clients&#x27; concerns. Somewhere in the\n            summer of 2019[, he] met with [plaintiffs] at [their]\n            home next door to [the Property]. [His]\n            determination . . . [was] that the existing use by\n            Site[s]capes was a pre[]existing non-conforming use\n            and that the restrictions [plaintiffs] wanted [to]\n            enforce[] were not applicable. He notified [plaintiffs&#x27;\n            counsel] and [plaintiffs] of [his] findings.\n\n      After Vinegra advised plaintiffs that Sitescapes&#x27; &quot;use was consistent with\n\nthe prior uses which utilized the site in the past[,]&quot; plaintiffs&#x27; counsel &quot;did not\n\npursue any additional determinations after [their] on-site meeting.&quot; Based on\n\nhis review of the historical uses of the property, Vinegra advised the Board\n\n&quot;Site[s]capes . . . is a landscaping/mason/general site contractor which is NOT\n\nsubstantially different from the previous uses since 1970.&quot; His &quot;professional\n\nopinion&quot; as the Zoning Officer was that &quot;Site[s]capes compli[ed] with the\n\nprovisions as a &#x27;construction contractors&#x27; yard&#x27; and is a pre[]existing non-\n\nconforming use. Thus, they are operating legally as far as zoning regulations.&quot;\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                       10\n\f      On July 22, 2020, plaintiffs&#x27; attorney wrote to the Board claiming\n\nVinegra&#x27;s July 17, 2020 correspondence &quot;constitute[s] &#x27;a decision or refusal\n\nmade by an administrative officer based on or made in the enforcement of the\n\nzoning ordinance,&#x27; contemplated by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(a).&quot;               Plaintiffs\n\nrequested the hearing on their appeal be adjourned to August 26, 2020. It was\n\nsubsequently rescheduled for September 30, 2020.\n\n      On September 30, 2020, Donald Fraser, Esq., the Board&#x27;s attorney,\n\nadvised the Board that &quot;before [it] can, or should, reach the question of whether\n\nor not the activities of [Sitescapes] are in compliance with the applicable\n\n[z]oning [o]rdinance, and/or any prior approvals granted by the Board and/or\n\nany municipal official, the Board must first address the question of whether it\n\nhas jurisdiction to consider the matter, and/or to grant whatever relief may be\n\nsought.&quot;\n\n      Fraser concluded plaintiffs&#x27; appeal &quot;is a matter for the courts, and not for\n\nthe . . . Board     to     decide.&quot;             He       concluded       plaintiffs\n\n&quot;[f]undamentally . . . seek[] . . . to enforce the zoning ordinance against\n\n[Sitescapes], contending that the activities taking place at [the Property] violate\n\nthe zoning ordinance.&quot; According to Fraser,\n\n             The [Board] is not the entity charged with enforcement.\n             If the [plaintiffs] believe that the Zoning Officer is\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                       11\n\f            improperly failing to discharge his duties, the\n            [plaintiffs] could either file a citizen&#x27;s complaint in\n            [m]unicipal [c]ourt. . . . [or] the [plaintiffs] could file in\n            Superior Court, and seek either injunctive relief against\n            [Sitescapes], and/or a mandamus compelling the\n            Zoning Officer to act.\n\n      In addition, Fraser advised the Board that plaintiffs&#x27; &quot;appeal [was]\n\nuntimely&quot; because it was filed more than twenty days after the Zoning Officer&#x27;s\n\ndecision, in violation of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-72. Specifically, Vinegra &quot;met with\n\n[plaintiffs and their attorney] in the summer of 2019. Whether or not [plaintiffs]\n\nwere aware of [Vinegra&#x27;s] decision prior to the time of the meeting in the\n\nsummer of 2019, they clearly were aware of it by then. Hence, the [twenty] days\n\nexpired long before the submission of [plaintiffs&#x27;] present appeal.&quot; Lastly,\n\nFraser did &quot;not see a basis for [plaintiffs&#x27;] request for interpretation under\n\nN.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(b)&quot; because &quot;[t]hat subsection . . . relates to interpretation\n\nof &#x27;the zoning map or ordinance,&#x27; which is not at issue in this case.&quot;\n\n      On September 30, 2020, the Board considered plaintiffs&#x27; appeal and\n\napplication at a public meeting. Plaintiffs&#x27; counsel appeared at the hearing and\n\nargued in opposition to the denial of the appeal and application. On October 14,\n\n2020, the Borough adopted a resolution denying plaintiffs&#x27; January 23, 2020\n\nappeal and application, based on &quot;the reasons set forth in [Fraser&#x27;s] September\n\n30, 2020 [o]pinion [l]etter.&quot;\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                        12\n\f      In a letter dated October 19, 2020, Vinegra advised Sitescapes he\n\n&quot;[o]riginally . . . issued a letter permitting the continuance of a landscaping\n\ncompany&quot;     and   &quot;[s]ince   the   April   18,   2018   letter,   [he]   believe[d]\n\n[Sitescapes] . . . expanded into the heavy excavating/trucking business[,] which\n\nis not landscaping.&quot;       He demanded Sitescapes correct the violations\n\nimmediately.\n\n      On October 20, 2020, the Borough Zoning Enforcement Officer issued a\n\nviolation notice to Sitescapes for (1) &quot;expansion of non-conforming use \u2013\n\ntandem dump trucks;&quot; (2) &quot;dumpster in front yard, unscreened;&quot; and (3) &quot;high\n\nintensity lighting not shielded.&quot; On November 2, 2020, the Zoning Enforcement\n\nOfficer issued a violation notice update stating, &quot;[t]he condition [was] corrected\n\nsatisfactorily.&quot;\n\n      On November 28, 2020, plaintiffs filed an action &quot;in [l]ieu of [p]rerogative\n\n[w]rits and for other relief&quot; against the Borough Defendants and Sitescapes. On\n\nOctober 18, 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. As to the Borough\n\nDefendants, plaintiffs alleged: (1) improperly expanded non-conforming use of\n\nthe Property (count one); (2) the Borough is required to enforce its own\n\nordinances under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-18 (count two); (3) the Board declining to\n\nrule on their appeal and application was improper (count three); (4) civil action\n\n\n                                                                              A-3086-23\n                                       13\n\ffor deprivation of rights (count four); and (5) writ of mandamus (count five).\n\nAs against all defendants, plaintiffs alleged: (1) public nuisance on land harming\n\nneighbors (count six); and (2) private nuisance (count seven).\n\n      At his deposition, Vinegra testified Sitescapes&#x27; use of the Property is a\n\n&quot;preexisting non[-]conformity of a construction yard.&quot;        He confirmed five\n\nentities owned the Property prior to 2018 based on information &quot;from an\n\nenvironmental report&quot; prepared by Peak Environmental in September 1998.\n\nAccording to that report, all five prior owners used the Property as a construction\n\nyard. &quot;Outside of the report by Peak Environmental and [his] follow-up as to\n\ndates of ownership with previous owners,&quot; he &quot;look[ed] at historical\n\nphotographs in Google Earth&quot; to confirm Sitescapes&#x27; use of the Property was a\n\npreexisting non-conforming use.\n\n      Vinegra &quot;investigated the [P]roperty&quot; and observed &quot;rear yard storage&quot;\n\nand &quot;some side yard storage&quot; for &quot;[c]onstruction material.&quot;             He &quot;took\n\nphotographs&quot; which depicted &quot;four-by-four posts,&quot; &quot;concrete block,&quot; and\n\n&quot;storage racks.&quot;     He saw &quot;the same storage . . . in previous historical\n\nphotographs.&quot; According to Vinegra, Landover also &quot;had construction material,\n\nand they had racks of scaffolding, those types of things.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                       14\n\f      At his deposition, Morocho testified he was aware the Property was a\n\ncommercial property when he purchased his adjoining property in 2015. When\n\nSitescapes arrived in 2016, he &quot;started to see a lot of activity, because the trucks\n\nthat they own . . . [are] . . . big industrial-grade trucks, and . . . there was a lot\n\nof noise that was produced by these trucks, back-up alarms.&quot; He recalled\n\nSitescapes applied for &quot;a zoning permit to put a fence . . . right into the property\n\nline,&quot; which &quot;basically . . . remove[d] the buffer area&quot; between his property and\n\nthe Property.\n\n      Morocho could not recall if Vinegra told him directly in 2019 that\n\nSitescapes&#x27; use of the Property was a preexisting non-conforming use. However,\n\nhe admitted he received an email from Vinegra stating Sitescapes was operating\n\nlawfully. He agreed the historical research performed by Peak Environmental\n\nshowing the Property&#x27;s previous uses from 1974 to 2020 was accurate, but\n\nclaimed Landover&#x27;s use was not &quot;construction&quot; and &quot;iron workers.&quot;\n\n      He testified Sitescapes&#x27; use of the Property was a nuisance because &quot;the\n\ndump trucks [it] uses are large, commercial trucks.

And . . . [he] think[s] that[ is] when the [B]oard failed to just\n\nto listen to [him] . . . and tell [him], . . . [whether] the resolution is valid, or it[\n\nis] invalid.&quot;     He conceded he is &quot;essentially . . . appealing [Vinegra&#x27;s]\n\ndetermination that [Sitescapes&#x27; use] is a non[-]conforming preexisting use&quot;\n\nbecause it &quot;had to go before the [B]oard and explain on paper what\n\nexact[] . . . type of business they were going to be running from the site.&quot; Thus,\n\nMorocho&#x27;s &quot;two goals [with his appeal was an] interpretation of the 2004\n\n[R]esolution and to overturn the decision . . . Vinegra made that Site[s]capes is\n\nnot in violation and operating lawfully as a non[-]conforming preexisting use.&quot;\n\n      Jeffrey Gabriel, the owner of Sitescapes, testified that the &quot;Union County\n\nBoard of Health&quot; conducted a &quot;noise visit&quot; at the Property.              &quot;They tested\n\n[Sitescapes&#x27;] . . . vehicles and machinery in [their] daily operations&quot; and\n\n&quot;[s]pent a few hours at the [P]roperty and they passed.&quot;\n\n\n                                                                                 A-3086-23\n                                          16\n\f                                        II.\n\n      After the completion of discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment.         On April 19, 2024, the judge heard oral argument.\n\nPlaintiffs&#x27; counsel argued &quot;[t]he real question here . . . is whether or not the\n\ncontinued use of this [P]roperty . . . exceeds its use as it was prior to the\n\nordinance making it a non-permitted use.&quot;        &quot;Plaintiffs are challenging the\n\nintensity of the use of the [P]roperty and whether or not it exceeds the\n\npreexisting use that it is.&quot; He conceded the zoning officer determined &quot;in 2018,\n\nthat this [P]roperty is a preexisting non-conforming use.&quot;\n\n      On April 23, the judge entered orders denying plaintiffs&#x27; motion and\n\ngranting defendants&#x27; motions, supported by a written opinion.          The judge\n\ndismissed counts six, alleging public nuisance, and seven, alleging private\n\nnuisance, against the Borough Defendants because plaintiffs failed to serve a\n\ntimely notice of tort claim as required by the New Jersey Tort Claims Act (TCA),\n\nN.J.S.A. 59:8-1 to -11.\n\n      The judge determined count two alleging &quot;failure to enforce an ordinance\n\nin violation of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-18,&quot; was precluded by N.J.S.A. 59:2-4, which\n\nprovides &quot;[a] public entity is not liable for any injury caused by . . . failing to\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                       17\n\fenforce any law.&quot; She also found, &quot;the record [was] devoid of information\n\nestablishing that the [Borough] [D]efendants failed to enforce&quot; an ordinance.\n\n      The judge dismissed counts one, alleging Sitescapes improperly expanded\n\nthe non-conforming use of the property; three, alleging that the Board\n\nimproperly declined to rule on plaintiffs&#x27; appeal and application; and five,\n\nseeking a writ of mandamus, because plaintiffs failed to file their action in lieu\n\nof prerogative writs within forty-five &quot;days after the accrual of the right to\n\nreview, hearing[,] or relief claimed&quot; as required by Rule 4:69-6(a). She rejected\n\nplaintiffs&#x27; contention that the forty-five-day time bar should be relaxed pursuant\n\nto Rule 4:69-6(c). The judge found the case did not involve &quot;an important and\n\nnovel constitutional question; ex parte determination of [a] legal question by\n\nadministrative officials; or important public rather than private interests.&quot;\n\n      The judge nevertheless addressed the merits of plaintiffs&#x27; claims and\n\ndetermined &quot;Site[s]capes use of the Property is not an improper expansion of a\n\nnon-conforming use.&quot;      She found &quot;Vinegra did a proper investigation into\n\ndetermining whether . . . Site[s]capes use of the Property was a conforming\n\nuse.&quot; The judge determined\n\n            Vinegra relied on the [Peak Environmental] [r]eport in\n            which the authors . . . obtained land use records from\n            the [Borough]. Within the records, it stated that the\n            prior     uses      of       the     Property     were\n\n                                                                                A-3086-23\n                                       18\n\f            landscaping/construction            yard;       construction\n            yard/mason; construction yard/roofing; construction\n            yard/street sweeping; construction yard/iron workers;\n            and              construction               yard/landscaper.\n            Additionally, . . . Vinegra        reviewed        historical\n            photographs to see what was stored on the Property in\n            the past and how the previous owners used it; visited\n            the Property to observe . . . Site[s]capes&#x27; use of the\n            Property; and spoke with the prior owners on the\n            previous use of the Property. [Borough] Ordinance\n            106-123 states that business hours must be closed\n            between 12:00 [a.m.] and 5:00 [a.m.], here plaintiffs\n            argue that . . . Site[s]capes start[s] to use the Property\n            at 5:30 [a.m.]. . . . Site[s]capes&#x27; use of the Property does\n            not violate the Ordinance.\n\nThe judge concluded &quot;the record is devoid of any information showing\n\nthat . . . Site[s]capes[&#x27;] use of the Property is substantially different than the\n\nprior uses of the Property.&quot;\n\n      The judge also dismissed count four, alleging a violation of the New\n\nJersey Civil Rights Act (CRA), N.J.S.A. 10:6-1 to -2, because plaintiffs did &quot;not\n\nprovide[] sufficient evidence to show that their substantive rights were\n\nviolated.&quot; She found &quot;[t]here has been no evidence provided that shows that\n\n[the Borough Defendants] declined to hear plaintiffs&#x27; application because of\n\ntheir race, national origin, age, and disability.&quot; The judge did &quot;not find that the\n\n[Borough] [D]efendants&#x27; actions &#x27;shock the conscience.&#x27;&quot;\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                        19\n\f      The judge concluded plaintiffs&#x27; reliance on Harz v.

Additionally, [plaintiffs&#x27; attorney] was able\n            to rebut comments and questions made by the Board.\n\n      The judge rejected plaintiffs&#x27; claim that the Borough&#x27;s October 14, 2020\n\nresolution denying their appeal and application was arbitrary, capricious, or\n\nunreasonable.   She found the Board correctly determined plaintiffs&#x27; appeal\n\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(a) was untimely because it was not filed within\n\ntwenty days of Vinegra&#x27;s determination that Sitescapes did not substantially\n\nchange or expand the non-conforming use of the Property.\n\n      Specifically, the judge found &quot;[u]nder N.J.S.A. 40:55D-72, appeals to the\n\n[B]oard may be taken by an interested party who is affected by a decision of an\n\nadministrative officer within twenty days of the decision&quot; and &quot;the time for\n\nnotice of the appeal begins to run when the interested party knew or should have\n\nknown&quot; of the decision. The judge determined Vinegra &quot;had an on-site meeting\n\nwith plaintiffs&#x27; former counsel in the summer of 2019 and informed\n\n                                                                             A-3086-23\n                                       20\n\fboth . . . Morocho and his counsel of . . . Vinegra&#x27;s findings&quot; and &quot;had numerous\n\nconversations with . . . Morocho and counsel . . . about . . . Morocho&#x27;s concerns\n\nin 2019.&quot; Based on that, the judge found &quot;plaintiffs either knew or should have\n\nknown of the pre[]existing non[-]conforming use [decision] issued to []\n\nSite[s]capes between late 2018 and early 2019&quot; and their &quot;appeal in January\n\n2020 was well past the deadline to appeal pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-72.&quot;\n\n      The judge rejected plaintiffs&#x27; claim that their application sought the\n\ninterpretation of a zoning map or ordinance pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(b).\n\nShe found &quot;[t]he letters sent on December 5, 2019 and January 7, 2020, d[id]\n\nnot request [the] interpretation of [an] [o]rdinance.&quot; She found &quot;[t]he record is\n\nclear that plaintiff[s] [were] appealing the determination that . . . Site[s]capes\n\nuse of the Property was a nonconforming use.&quot; &quot;Absent from these letters is\n\nplaintiffs&#x27; request for an interpretation&quot; of a zoning map or ordinance.\n\n      The judge determined &quot;plaintiffs are unable to establish that the Board\n\nacted in an arbitrary and capricious fashion by not hearing [their]&quot; appeal and\n\napplication. &quot;There [was] sufficient evidence that establishes that the Board&#x27;s\n\ndecision to deny plaintiff&#x27;s [appeal and] application was based on due\n\nconsideration.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-3086-23\n                                       21\n\f      The judge rejected plaintiffs&#x27; demand for a writ of mandamus because\n\n&quot;plaintiff[s] . . . failed to establish that there was a clear violation of [a Borough]\n\n[o]rdinance and a failure to take action by the [Borough] [D]efendants.&quot;\n\n      The judge determined plaintiffs&#x27; public and private nuisance claims\n\nagainst the Borough Defendants failed as a matter of law because there &quot;has\n\nbeen no allegations asserted against the [Borough] [D]efendants that they own\n\nthe . . . [P]roperty&quot; and &quot;plaintiff[s] . . . failed to properly file a notice of tort\n\nclaim.&quot; She also determined plaintiffs&#x27; public nuisance claim failed against all\n\ndefendants because plaintiffs &quot;have not provided any evidence showing that\n\nplaintiffs are suffering a harm different from that suffered by other members of\n\nthe public.&quot;\n\n      Finally,     the   judge    determined     plaintiffs   &quot;failed   to   establish\n\nthat . . . Site[s]capes[&#x27;] use of the Property constitute[s] a private nuisance.&quot; She\n\nfound:\n\n               the record is devoid of any information establishing the\n               dates and times when the alleged nuisance would occur\n               or the frequency [or] magnitude of the alleged nuisance.\n               Plaintiffs        have         provided        photographs\n               of . . . Site[s]capes&#x27; use of the [P]roperty, which depicts\n               the trucks and storage on the Property; however [the]\n               photographs have not been authenticated by plaintiffs.\n               Plaintiffs have complained that the noise of the trucks\n               [is] loud; however, plaintiffs have provided no decibel\n               reading as to the noise[.] . . . Conversely, [Sitescapes&#x27;\n\n                                                                                A-3086-23\n                                          22\n\f            representative] testified that the Union County Board of\n            Health tested the noise levels on the Property\n            and . . . Site[s]capes passed.       The only evidence\n            plaintiffs have presented . . . regarding their private\n            nuisance claim is . . . Morocho&#x27;s own complaints;\n            however, without any evidence to support such\n            complaints, no reasonable fact finder can conclude\n            that . . . Site[s]capes&#x27; use of the Property constituted a\n            private nuisance.\n\n\n                                       III.\n\n      On appeal, plaintiffs argue they &quot;have standing to bring this suit.&quot;\n\nSpecifically, they contend their claim pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-18 is not an\n\n&quot;action in lieu of prerogative writs tried on the record below&quot; or &quot;a demand for\n\ndamages under the&quot; TCA. They argue the judge improperly dismissed their\n\nprivate nuisance claim because it &quot;was not against a public entity.&quot; Plaintiffs\n\ncontend their nuisance claim is subject to the &quot;continuing tort doctrine&quot; and the\n\njudge &quot;erroneously dismissed [their] claims &#x27;with prejudice&#x27; without addressing\n\nthe date [on] which the statute of limitations commenced.&quot;\n\n      Plaintiffs argue the judge improperly determined their action in lieu of\n\nprerogative writs was untimely because they &quot;challenge the present use of the\n\nProperty, and whether or not it has been illegally intensified since the Zoning\n\nOfficer&#x27;s issuance of the 2018 Zoning Certificate/Permit.&quot; In the alternative,\n\nthey argue the judge &quot;should have granted [plaintiffs] an enlargement of time&quot;\n\n                                                                           A-3086-23\n                                       23\n\fpursuant to Rule 4:69-6(c) &quot;to determine whether there was an incorrect and/or\n\nillegal administrative determination of a zoning officer without a proper\n\ninvestigation into the preexisting non[-]conforming use.&quot;          They also argue\n\n&quot;[m]uch like the &#x27;continuing tort doctrine[,]&#x27; the need to determine actual dates\n\nof actionable claims renders any decision by the [judge] as to the applicability\n\nof [the] statute of limitations moot.&quot;\n\n      Plaintiffs next contend the Board&#x27;s October 14, 2020 resolution was\n\narbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable because they &quot;were not challenging the\n\n2018 or 2019 &#x27;determinations&#x27; of the Zoning Officer.&quot;            Rather, they &quot;were\n\nchallenging the inaction of the Zoning Officer&quot; and the &quot;Board failed to grasp\n\nwhat exactly was being appealed.&quot; Plaintiffs argue the judge &quot;[w]rongfully\n\n[d]etermined Site[s]capes . . . [d]id not [i]llegally [e]xpand the [p]reexisting\n\n[n]on[-]conforming [u]se of the Property.&quot; They contend &quot;there is, at the very\n\nleast, a triable issue of fact.&quot;\n\n      Plaintiffs contend the judge improperly dismissed their CRA claim\n\nbecause      they     &quot;reasonably     expected     to     have      the    Borough\n\n[Defendants] . . . exercise [their] duty to properly act to enforce the [o]rdinances\n\nto protect [plaintiffs&#x27;] substantive due process and property rights&quot; and &quot;at the\n\nvery least, hear the merits of their [a]pplication.&quot; Plaintiffs argue the judge\n\n\n                                                                              A-3086-23\n                                         24\n\fimproperly denied their request for a writ of mandamus because they &quot; have a\n\nclear right to the relief sought&quot; and the Borough Defendants &quot;are under a clear\n\nand definite duty to act.&quot; Lastly, plaintiffs contend the judge erred when she\n\nfailed to find that genuine issues of material fact exist related to Sitescapes&#x27;\n\nalleged nuisance on the Property.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n      Our review of a trial court&#x27;s grant or denial of a motion for summary\n\njudgment is de novo.

Posey v. Bordentown Sewerage Auth.\">171 N.J. 172, 181</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002). A\n\nparty has ninety days from the accrual of a claim to file notice of a claim against\n\na public entity. N.J.S.A. 59:8-8(a). Here, plaintiffs were aware of the alleged\n\nnuisance at the Property no later than 2019. They never served a notice of tort\n\nclaim as required by the TCA. Accordingly, their purported nuisance claims\n\nagainst the Borough Defendants are precluded.\n\n      We are convinced the judge properly dismissed count two of plaintiffs&#x27;\n\namended complaint alleging the Borough Defendants &quot;failed to enforce&quot; a\n\nBorough ordinance &quot;under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-18.&quot; That statute provides that a\n\n&quot;governing body of a municipality shall enforce . . . any ordinance&quot; if &quot;any\n\nbuilding, structure[,]or land is used in violation of . . . any ordinance.&quot; N.J.S.A.\n\n40:55D-18. Here, plaintiffs contend the Borough Defendants failed to enforce\n\nBorough Ordinance \u00a7 106-122(B) (the Ordinance), which provides &quot;[n]o\n\nexisting use, structure[,] or premises devoted to a non[-]conforming use shall be\n\nenlarged, extended, reconstructed, substituted[,] or structurally altered, unless it\n\nis changed to a conforming use.&quot;\n\n\n                                                                              A-3086-23\n                                        27\n\f      We are persuaded the judge correctly determined the Borough Defendants\n\nhave not failed to enforce the Ordinance. Rather, the Borough Defendants\n\ndetermined that Sitescapes&#x27; use of the Property is a permitted non-conforming\n\nuse and Sitescapes is not violating the Ordinance. Plaintiffs&#x27; claim is based not\n\non the Borough Defendants&#x27; failure to enforce the Ordinance, but on their\n\ndisagreement with the Borough Defendants&#x27; determination regarding Sitescapes&#x27;\n\nuse of the Property. The Borough Defendants are enforcing the Ordinance; they\n\nare just not enforcing it the way plaintiffs want them to.\n\n      Plaintiffs&#x27; claims under the CRA lack merit for the same reasons. The\n\njudge properly concluded the Borough Defendants have not deprived plaintiffs\n\nof a substantive right. There is no basis to find they &quot;intentionally&quot; failed to\n\n&quot;exercise proper oversight over the Property&quot; or &quot;enforce [the] Ordinance.&quot;\n\nPlaintiffs&#x27; claim that the Board failed to hear their appeal and application is\n\nincorrect. The Board heard the matter at a public meeting and determined the\n\nappeal was untimely and the &quot;application&quot; for an interpretation of a &quot;zoning map\n\nor ordinance&quot; lacked merit.\n\n      We are satisfied the judge correctly determined the Board&#x27;s October 14,\n\n2020 resolution denying plaintiffs&#x27; appeal and application was not arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or unreasonable. When considering an appeal from an action taken\n\n\n                                                                           A-3086-23\n                                       28\n\fby a planning board, a reviewing court must determine whether the board&#x27;s\n\ndecision was &quot;arbitrary, capricious[,] or unreasonable.&quot; Fallone Props., L.L.C.\n\nv.

He committed these offenses at the\n\nage of nineteen.\n\n      During the sentencing hearing, the judge found numerous aggravating\n\nfactors, including the nature and circumstances of the offenses, extreme\n\nindifference to human life, risk of recidivism, and need to deter similar conduct.\n\nThe judge found \"no mitigating factors whatsoever.\" The judge sentenced\n\nFlorence to a life term subject to thirty years of parole ineligibility on the felony\n\nmurder conviction and a consecutive term of twenty years subject to ten years\n\nof parole ineligibility on the armed robbery conviction to be served consecutive\n\nto the felony murder sentence.\n\n      In 1997, Florence filed a direct appeal from his convictions and sentence.\n\nThis court affirmed the convictions and rejected Florence's sentencing\n\narguments as \"without merit.\" State v. Florence, No. A-0774-94 (App. Div.

The trial court denied the petition in March 1999.\n\n       In 2000, Florence appealed the denial of his PCR petition to this court,\n\narguing ineffective assistance of PCR counsel. We affirmed, determining the\n\nissues raised \"without sufficient merit to warrant disposition in a written\n\nopinion.\" State v. Florence, No. A-6012-98 (App. Div. Oct. 18, 2000) (slip op.\n\nat 3), certif. denied, 167 N.J. 633 (2001). We concluded \"the evidence of\n\ndefendant's guilt was overwhelming, and post-conviction counsel could not\n\nchange that.\" Id. at 5.\n\n       In 2011, Florence filed a motion for a new trial based on new evidence.\n\nState v. Florence, No. A-0275-08 (App. Div. Feb. 23, 2011) (slip op. at 4), certif.\n\ndenied, 207 N.J. 224 (2011). Florence asserted a 2006 letter from an individual\n\nwho served as a juror at his trial indicated \"some reservations about the verdict.\"\n\nId. at 2.\n\n       In 2007, the trial judge voir dired the juror who wrote the letter. The trial\n\njudge denied defendant's new trial motion, finding the veracity of the 2006 letter\n\nfrom the juror \"highly questionable\" so many years after defendant's 1994\n\nconviction. Id. at 7.\n\n\n                                                                              A-0858-23\n                                         3\n\f      On appeal, we affirmed the trial judge's rejection of defendant's contention\n\nthat improper extraneous information had the capacity to influence the trial's\n\noutcome warranting a new trial. Id. at 7-8.\n\n      In 2014, Florence attempted to file an appeal from a July 24, 2013 order\n\ndenying his second PCR petition. State v. Florence, No. A-0935-14 (App. Div.\n\nJan. 9, 2015), certif. denied, 222 N.J. 14 (2015). Due to the passage of time\n\nbetween the order denying the second PCR petition and Florence's notice of\n\nappeal, he was instructed to file a motion allowing the notice of appeal as within\n\ntime. We denied the within time motion and dismissed the appeal.\n\n      In 2018, the United States District Court of New Jersey denied Florence's\n\nwrit of habeas corpus. See generally Florence v. Hendricks, 2018 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 158262 (D.N.J. Sept. 17, 2018), aff'd sub. nom., Florence v. Adm'r N.J.\n\nState Prison, U.S. App. LEXIS 40646 (3rd Cir. Mar. 11, 2019).\n\n      In March 2023, Florence filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence,\n\nrelying on State v. Comer, 249 N.J. 359 (2022). Before the motion judge,\n\nFlorence asserted he qualified as a \"late adolescent\" at the time of his crimes\n\nand his \"'youth' was not properly considered\" under Comer. Florence argued\n\nthe holding in Comer should be applied to \"late adolescents\" because \"the\n\nconsensus in the scientific community is that the developmental brain science\n\n\n                                                                            A-0858-23\n                                        4\n\faccepted by the New Jersey Supreme Court is actually applicable to offenders\n\nin their mid-twenties.\" Additionally, Florence contended his \"sentence [wa]s\n\nillegal because there was no 'overall fairness' assessment conducted before the\n\nimposition of maximum consecutive sentences\" on his armed robbery\n\nconvictions. Further, Florence argued the sentencing judge improperly relied\n\non evidence of conduct related to an offense for which the jury acquitted him.\n\nBased on these arguments, Florence requested a remand for resentencing.\n\n      The motion judge denied the motion. She rejected Florence's youth-based\n\narguments because Florence was over eighteen years old when he committed the\n\noffenses. The judge found the remainder of Florence's arguments were litigated\n\nand rejected on direct appeal.\n\n      On appeal, defendant raises the following arguments:\n\n            Point One\n\n            THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD DEFENDANT'S\n            SENTENCE OF LIFE WITH A [FORTY] YEAR\n            PAROLE BAR, WHICH WAS IMPOSED WITHOUT\n            CONSIDERATION OF HIS \"LATE ADOLESCENT\"\n            STATUS, CONSTITUTES CRUEL AND UNUSUAL\n            PUNISHMENT,       AS        DEVELOPING\n            NEUROSCIENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE\n            LAW'S HEIGHTENED PROTECTIONS FOR THE\n            SENTENCING OF JUVENILES SHOULD APPLY TO\n            OFFENDERS AGED [EIGHTEEN] TO [TWENTY]\n            YEARS, THEREFORE DEFENDANT SHOULD BE\n\n\n                                                                          A-0858-23\n                                      5\n\fRESENTENCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE\nv.

Additionally, our\nCourt Has Now Provided a Right to a Miller\nResentencing for Juveniles Sentenced for Murder Who\nHave Served [Twenty] Years. See[] State v. Comer,\n249 N.J. 359 (2022).\n\nB. Late Adolescents Share Juveniles' \"Distinctive\nAttributes of Youth.\"\n\nC. A Life With a Consecutive [Twenty]-Year Sentence\nWith a [Forty]-Year Parole Disqualifier Is \"Grossly\nDisproportionate\" to Defendant.\n\nD. \"Evolving Standards of Decency\" Demonstrate That\nDefendant's Sentence Without Consideration of Youth\nIs Cruel and Unusual Punishment.\n\nPoint Two\n\nTHIS      COURT  SHOULD   REMAND     FOR\nRESENTENCING TO PERMIT THE TRIAL COURT\nTO      RECONSIDER   THE    CONSECUTIVE\nSENTENCES IN LIGHT OF STATE v. TORRES, 246\nN.J. 246 (2021).\n\nPoint Three\n\nTHIS MATTER SHOULD BE REMANDED TO THE\nTRIAL COURT FOR RESENTENCING BECAUSE\nTHE   SENTENCING   JUDGE  BASED    HIS\nSENTENCING DECISION IN PART ON FACTS\n\n                                                          A-0858-23\n                          6\n\f             FROM COUNTS OF THE INDICTMENT ON WHICH\n             DEFENDANT WAS ACQUITTED.\n\n      We review the disposition of a motion to correct an illegal sentence de\n\nnovo. State v. Drake, 444 N.J. Super. 265, 271 (App. Div. 2016). \"[A]n illegal\n\nsentence is one that 'exceeds the maximum penalty . . . for a particular offense'\n\nor a sentence 'not imposed in accordance with law.'\" State v. Acevedo, 205 N.J.\n\n40, 45 (2011) (quoting State v. Murray, 165 N.J. 240, 247 (2000)). This includes\n\na sentence \"imposed without regard to some constitutional safeguard.\" State v.\n\nZuber, 227 N.J. 442, 437 (2017). There is no temporal limit on a court's ability\n\nto review an illegal sentence; it \"can be corrected at any time.\" Acevedo, 205\n\nN.J. at 47 n.4.\n\n      Here, Florence argues for resentencing based on developments in the field\n\nof neuroscience suggesting lengthy sentences should not be imposed for\n\noffenders of his age at the time he committed his crimes. He claims the motion\n\njudge erred in declining to conduct a resentencing hearing under Comer. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n      In Comer, our Supreme Court held \"juveniles may petition the court to\n\nreview their sentence after [twenty] years.\" 249 N.J. at 401. Although the Court\n\nspecifically reserved this procedure for juveniles, Florence argues \"late\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-0858-23\n                                       7\n\fadolescents\" share similar biological characteristics to juveniles, supporting\n\napplication of Comer to young adults.\n\n      Guided by our decision in State v. Sean Jones, 478 N.J. Super. 532 (App.\n\nDiv.), certif. denied, 259 N.J. 304 (2024), we discern no support for defendant's\n\nargument that Comer should be applied to young adult offenders over the age of\n\neighteen at the time of the offenses. In Sean Jones, we rejected Florence's\n\nidentical argument that defendants who committed offenses as eighteen to\n\ntwenty year olds, warranted resentencing based on evolving scientific evidence\n\nregarding maturity. Id. at 542-43, 546-47. We declined to extend the Comer\n\nlookback period to defendants who were eighteen to twenty years of age at the\n\ntime of their crimes. Id. at 549. Notwithstanding modern scientific evidence,\n\nwe explained: \"'The Legislature has chosen eighteen as the threshold age for\n\nadulthood in criminal sentencing. Although this choice may seem arbitrary, a\n\nline must be drawn,' and '[t]he age of [eighteen] is the point where society draws\n\nthe line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood.'\" Id. at 550-51\n\n(quoting State v. Ryan, 249 N.J. 581, 600 n.10 (2022)).\n\n      Florence was nineteen years old when he committed his crimes and thus\n\nfell within the age range contemplated and rejected under Sean Jones. Id. at\n\n549. As the motion judge noted in denying Florence's motion to correct an\n\n\n                                                                            A-0858-23\n                                        8\n\fillegal sentence, Comer \"can only be retroactively applied, for individuals that\n\nwere sentenced to life sentences that were under the age of [eighteen] at the\n\ntime.\" We are satisfied the motion judge correctly denied Florence's motion to\n\ncorrect an illegal sentence because he was over the age of eighteen at the time\n\nhe committed his crimes.\n\n      We next address Florence's asserted entitlement to a remand for\n\nresentencing. He argues the sentencing judge failed to assess the overall fairness\n\nof imposing consecutive sentences under State v. Torres, 246 N.J. 246 (2021).\n\nFlorence premises his argument based upon his age at the time he committed the\n\ncrimes. He asserts the sentencing judge did not adequately consider his age\n\nwhen imposing consecutive sentences as required by Torres.\n\n      It is well-settled that Torres did not announce a new rule of law. Rather,\n\nTorres merely extended the required analysis under State v. Yarbough, 100 N.J.\n\n627, 643-45 (1985), to be considered by sentencing courts in deciding whether\n\nto impose sentences consecutively or concurrently. See Torres, 246 N.J. at 270\n\n(\"reiterat[ing] the repeated instruction that a sentencing court's decision whether\n\nto impose consecutive sentences should retain focus on 'the fairness of the\n\noverall sentence'\") (quoting State v. Miller, 108 N.J. 112, 122 (1987)).\n\nMoreover, even if we were to apply Torres, the New Jersey Supreme Court in\n\n\n                                                                             A-0858-23\n                                        9\n\fthat case \"reject[ed] any contention that taking age into account in the overall-\n\nfairness assessment [altered] in any way the focus of the stated purposes of the\n\n[Criminal] Code.\" Id. at 274.\n\n      Here, the motion judge found the sentencing judge, while not using the\n\nterm \"overall fairness,\" properly considered the Yarbough factors when\n\nimposing consecutive sentences based on the credible evidence. The sentencing\n\njudge noted Florence posed a significant risk of reoffending. The judge also\n\nfound a need to deter Florence from his \"dangerous\" behavior, requiring that he\n\nbe \"removed for a substantial period of time from society,\" and fashioned the\n\nsentence \"to achieve that objective.\"\n\n      Additionally, Florence's age at the time he committed the crimes was part\n\nof the trial evidence, included in the presentence investigation report submitted\n\nto the judge, and addressed by defense counsel at sentencing. Thus, the judge\n\nknew Florence's age when imposing consecutive sentences. On this record, we\n\nare satisfied the judge considered Florence's age and other relevant and\n\napplicable factors when imposing consecutive sentences.\n\n      We turn to Florence's argument that the sentencing judge erred in\n\n\"rel[ying] upon facts supplied by\" a witness related to counts for which he was\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-0858-23\n                                        10\n\flater acquitted. In support of his argument, Florence relies on State v. Melvin,\n\n248 N.J. 321 (2021). In Melvin, our Supreme Court held:\n\n            To permit the re-litigation of facts in a criminal case\n            under the lower preponderance of the evidence standard\n            would render the jury's role in the criminal justice\n            process null and would be fundamentally unfair. In\n            order to protect the integrity of our Constitution's right\n            to a criminal trial by jury, we simply cannot allow a\n            jury's verdict to be ignored through judicial fact-finding\n            at sentencing.\n\n            [248 N.J. at 349.]\n\n      Florence contends the sentencing judge engaged in impermissible\n\n\"judicial fact-finding at sentencing\" by relying on evidence of conduct from\n\ncounts on which the jury acquitted him. Florence argues the sentencing judge\n\n\"ignored\" the jury's acquittal on certain counts and his sentence should be\n\nreconsidered \"due to th[is] constitutional violation.\"\n\n      We reject Florence's arguments based on Melvin. Florence's 1997 direct\n\nappeal from his convictions and sentence concluded upon the New Jersey\n\nSupreme Court's denial of his petition for certification in 2001. See State v.\n\nFlorence, 167 N.J. 633 (2001). Only direct appeals pending when Melvin was\n\ndecided in 2021 could be accorded pipeline retroactivity. State v. Morente-\n\nDubon, 474 N.J. Super. 197, 213 (App. Div. 2022). Because Florence's direct\n\n\n\n                                                                          A-0858-23\n                                       11\n\fappeal was rejected with finality in 2001, he was not entitled to pipeline\n\nretroactivity under Melvin to warrant a remand for resentencing.\n\n      Further, our review of the sentencing transcript reveals the sentencing\n\njudge referred to defendant's acquitted conduct related to counts three and four\n\nas part of the judge's preliminary remarks. The judge's sentencing decision,\n\nmany pages later in the sentencing transcript, does not refer to any conduct on\n\nthese counts for which the jury acquitted defendant.\n\n      To the extent we have not specifically addressed any of defendant's\n\nremaining arguments, we are satisfied they lack sufficient merit to warrant\n\ndiscussion in a written opinion.

Florence argued\n\nthe holding in Comer should be applied to &quot;late adolescents&quot; because &quot;the\n\nconsensus in the scientific community is that the developmental brain science\n\n\n                                                                            A-0858-23\n                                        4\n\faccepted by the New Jersey Supreme Court is actually applicable to offenders\n\nin their mid-twenties.&quot; Additionally, Florence contended his &quot;sentence [wa]s\n\nillegal because there was no &#x27;overall fairness&#x27; assessment conducted before the\n\nimposition of maximum consecutive sentences&quot; on his armed robbery\n\nconvictions. Further, Florence argued the sentencing judge improperly relied\n\non evidence of conduct related to an offense for which the jury acquitted him.\n\nBased on these arguments, Florence requested a remand for resentencing.\n\n      The motion judge denied the motion.

He asserts the sentencing judge did not adequately consider his age\n\nwhen imposing consecutive sentences as required by Torres.\n\n      It is well-settled that Torres did not announce a new rule of law. Rather,\n\nTorres merely extended the required analysis under State v. Yarbough, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2160558\"><a href=\"/opinion/2160558/state-v-yarbough/#643\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: State v.

The sentencing\n\njudge noted Florence posed a significant risk of reoffending. The judge also\n\nfound a need to deter Florence from his &quot;dangerous&quot; behavior, requiring that he\n\nbe &quot;removed for a substantial period of time from society,&quot; and fashioned the\n\nsentence &quot;to achieve that objective.&quot;\n\n      Additionally, Florence&#x27;s age at the time he committed the crimes was part\n\nof the trial evidence, included in the presentence investigation report submitted\n\nto the judge, and addressed by defense counsel at sentencing. Thus, the judge\n\nknew Florence&#x27;s age when imposing consecutive sentences. On this record, we\n\nare satisfied the judge considered Florence&#x27;s age and other relevant and\n\napplicable factors when imposing consecutive sentences.\n\n      We turn to Florence&#x27;s argument that the sentencing judge erred in\n\n&quot;rel[ying] upon facts supplied by&quot; a witness related to counts for which he was\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-0858-23\n                                        10\n\flater acquitted. In support of his argument, Florence relies on State v. Melvin,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">248 N.J. 321</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2021). In Melvin, our Supreme Court held:\n\n            To permit the re-litigation of facts in a criminal case\n            under the lower preponderance of the evidence standard\n            would render the jury&#x27;s role in the criminal justice\n            process null and would be fundamentally unfair. In\n            order to protect the integrity of our Constitution&#x27;s right\n            to a criminal trial by jury, we simply cannot allow a\n            jury&#x27;s verdict to be ignored through judicial fact-finding\n            at sentencing.\n\n            [248 N.J. at 349.]\n\n      Florence contends the sentencing judge engaged in impermissible\n\n&quot;judicial fact-finding at sentencing&quot; by relying on evidence of conduct from\n\ncounts on which the jury acquitted him. Florence argues the sentencing judge\n\n&quot;ignored&quot; the jury&#x27;s acquittal on certain counts and his sentence should be\n\nreconsidered &quot;due to th[is] constitutional violation.&quot;\n\n      We reject Florence&#x27;s arguments based on Melvin. Florence&#x27;s 1997 direct\n\nappeal from his convictions and sentence concluded upon the New Jersey\n\nSupreme Court&#x27;s denial of his petition for certification in 2001.

Lombardo, Assistant\n                   Prosecutor, on the brief).\n\nPER CURIAM\n\f      In this driving while intoxicated (\"DWI\") case, the State relied on the\n\ncommunity caretaking doctrine to justify the police's encounter with defendant\n\nJoseph Blackham and his parked motor vehicle. Because the municipal court\n\nand the Law Division legally erred in finding the elements of community\n\ncaretaking were met here, we reverse defendant's DWI conviction.\n\n      The record reflects the following relevant facts and circumstances. At\n\napproximately midnight on June 14, 2021, four police officers were dispatched\n\nto defendant's residence in Netcong to respond to what was described as \"a\n\nverbal dispute.\" The dispatched officers included Officers Daniel LaManna and\n\nRichard Barbini of the Netcong Borough Police Department and Sergeant Guy\n\nMariani of the Byram Township Police Department, along with an additional\n\nofficer from a different department.\n\n      The officers found at the residence two persons involved in the verbal\n\ndispute: defendant and an adult woman (\"the cohabitant\") who reportedly had\n\nbeen living with defendant for about eleven years as of the incident. According\n\nto Officer LaManna's testimony at the municipal trial, both defendant and the\n\ncohabitant \"explained that they were drinking that evening.\" As described by\n\nLaManna, defendant exhibited slurred speech and had \"the odor of [an] alcoholic\n\nbeverage,\" causing LaManna to perceive that defendant was then intoxicated.\n\n\n                                                                         A-3722-23\n                                       2\n\f         Eventually, the verbal dispute was resolved, with the cohabitant \"walking\n\naway\" after the officers suggested she do so to de-escalate the situation. The\n\npolice then left the residence without issuing any summonses or taking further\n\naction.\n\n         Later that night, at 3:08 a.m., Sergeant Mariana called Officer LaManna\n\non his cell phone and told LaManna that he had just seen defendant driving a\n\nvehicle. Specifically, the sergeant reported that he had seen the cohabitant\n\n\"walking across Route 46 at the time, [and] get picked up in a green Jeep.\"\n\nBased on LaManna's knowledge \"from previous calls,\" he recognized the Jeep\n\nas a vehicle that defendant and the cohabitant shared.\n\n         Prompted by the sergeant's phone call, Officer LaManna then drove to\n\ndefendant\u2019s residence and observed a green Jeep parked in front of his house.\n\nAs recounted by LaManna, the Jeep \"was still running with the lights on, and\n\n[the cohabitant] was in the passenger seat and [defendant] was in the driver's\n\nseat.\"\n\n         After Officer LaManna activated his squad car's lights, the Jeep's ignition\n\ngot turned off, and both defendant and the cohabitant allegedly \"jumped out of\n\nthe car.\" Defendant went towards the Jeep's trunk and announced to LaManna\n\nthat he was closing it.\n\n\n                                                                              A-3722-23\n                                          3\n\f      Officer Barbini arrived at the scene shortly thereafter and administered to\n\ndefendant standard field sobriety tests (\"SFSTs\"). He did so based on Officer\n\nLaManna's belief that the tests were appropriate, given \"the odor of an alcoholic\n\nbeverage emanating\" from defendant's breath, his \"swaying,\" and his \"bloodshot\n\nand watery [eyes.]\"\n\n      Officer Barbini testified that defendant did not perform the SFSTs in a\n\nsatisfactory manner.1 Consequently, the police transported defendant to the\n\nRoxbury Police Department for an Alcotest.          The Alcotest revealed that\n\ndefendant had a blood alcohol concentration (\"BAC\") of 0.13%, above the\n\n0.08% legal limit. Defendant was accordingly charged with a violation of\n\nN.J.S.A 39:4-50.\n\n      In a one-day hearing, the municipal court judge heard testimony from\n\nOfficers LaManna and Barbini for the State, and from the cohabitant for the\n\ndefense. In his oral decision, the municipal court judge upheld the propriety of\n\nthe officers' actions and found the State had proven defendant's guilt.2\n\n\n\n1\n  As the municipal judge noted in his oral opinion, \"[D]efendant failed them . . .\n[he] was unable to maintain his balance . . . [or]follow the instructions.\"\n2\n A substantial amount of the trial concerned whether the SFSTs and the\nAlcotest had been properly administered, as well as whether defendant's BAC\n\n\n                                                                            A-3722-23\n                                        4\n\f      With respect to the police's second trip to the residence, the municipal\n\njudge found that \"the officers, doing their community caretaking, drove out to\n\nthe site, where they knew . . . there had been drinking earlier. And upon\n\narriving, witnessed the defendant behind the wheel of a car that was running,\n\nwith its lights on.\" [(Emphasis added).] The municipal judge further noted\n\n\"[t]he officers . . . observed what they observed. . . . [C]learly, . . . [defendant]\n\nhad operated the vehicle, that's without any doubt in the [c]ourt's mind, based\n\non all the testimony . . .\" Furthermore, the municipal judge expressed his\n\nsatisfaction that, after the officers had administered the SFSTs, there \"was\n\nsufficient probable cause to move forward . . . with the investigation.\"\n\n(Emphasis added). 3\n\n      Based on his findings, the municipal judge concluded defendant was\n\n\"guilty beyond any reasonable doubt of operating a motor vehicle . . . clearly\n\nunder the influence of alcohol, with a reading of a .13, all admitted into\n\nevidence.\"\n\n\nreading had been affected by an inhaler. Those testing issues have not been\nraised on appeal.\n3\n  Indeed, as we noted above, the municipal judge used the term \"investigation\"\nto refer to the police activities. Similarly, the Law Division judge used that\nterminology in stating that the police went back to defendant\u2019s residence at 3:08\na.m. in order to respond \"to the scene to investigate.\" (Emphasis added).\n                                                                              A-3722-23\n                                         5\n\f      In sentencing, the municipal judge imposed on defendant a seven-month\n\nlicense suspension with the option for an interlock device and twelve hours of\n\nIntoxicated Driver Resource Center training, plus the customary DWI surcharge,\n\nfines, court costs, and assessments.\n\n      Defendant appealed the municipal court's decision to the Law Division.\n\nAt the trial de novo held on June 12, 2024, the Law Division judge made the\n\nfollowing pertinent factual findings based on the record:\n\n            [T]he two officers responded to the scene based on Sergeant\n            Mariani's phone call observations . . . . and then the officers\n            responded to the defendant's residence.           They made\n            observations of the defendant and believed that he was under\n            the influence of an intoxicating liquor.\n\n               Defendant stated that ultimately . . . he did drive a few\n            blocks to pick-up [the cohabitant]. And that was certainly\n            confirmed by [the cohabitant's] testimony.\n\n                ....\n\n              [T]he results [of the Alcotest] indicated the defendant's\n            BAC was .13[%], certainly above the . . . legal limit of .08[%].\n\n    The Law Division judge rejected defendant's argument that there was no\n\nprobable cause for the police to require him to submit to an Alcotest, finding it\n\nsignificant that \"the officers [had] responded to the call at the residence of the\n\ndefendant earlier that night and noted at that point that the defendant appeared\n\nintoxicated.\"   Accordingly, the Law Division judge concluded that \"the\n\n                                                                               A-3722-23\n                                        6\n\fobservations of the field sobriety test . . . g[a]ve rise for probable cause to arrest\n\n. . . defendant under the influence of alcohol.\"\n\n     Notably for the purposes of the present appeal, the Law Division judge\n\nadopted the municipal judge's legal conclusion that the police encounter was\n\njustified by the community caretaking doctrine:\n\n             [The municipal judge] . . . correctly noted the officers\n             responded to the report of the defendant based on their\n             functions as community . . . caretakers. Cady v.\n             Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433 [(1973)]. Certainly under\n             the circumstances having previously observed the\n             defendant only two to three hours prior to the motor\n             vehicle stop under the influence of what they believed\n             [to be] an intoxicating liquor, after responding to a 9-1-\n             1 domestic violence call and clearing the scene,\n             ultimately being informed that the defendant was\n             operating the motor vehicle, they responded to the\n             scene to investigate.\n\nThe Law Division judge further noted that \"[a]fter arriving on the scene, . . .\n\n[Officer] LaManna saw the defendant sitting behind the wheel of the vehicle in\n\nquestion,\" and that it \"was uncontroverted[] that the vehicle was running and the\n\nlights were on as the officer responded.\" The officers \"subsequently observed\n\nthe defendant at that point in time and certainly had reasonable suspicion that\n\nhe was intoxicated.\"\n\n     Based on this evidence, the Law Division judge ruled that defendant had\n\noperated the motor vehicle and explained that this undisputed fact had been\n\n                                                                                A-3722-23\n                                          7\n\f\"confirmed . . . by the defendant's own statement and the statement of [the\n\ncohabitant].\" The judge further noted that \"[t]he motor vehicle code defines [an]\n\noperator as a person who is in actual physical control of a vehicle,\" quoting\n\nN.J.S.A. 39:1-1, and that \"courts have interpreted operation broadly,\" citing\n\nState v. Thompson, 462 N.J. Super. 370 (App. Div. 2020) and State v. Ebert,\n\n377 N.J. Super. 1 (App. Div. 2005).          Under this \"pragmatic and flexible\n\ninterpretation of operation,\" as the Law Division judge noted, \"the State does\n\nnot necessarily have to prove that the vehicle was in motion or even that the\n\nengine was running . . . in order to satisfy the element of the DWI statute,\" citing\n\nState v. Mulcahy, 107 N.J. 467 (1987). 4\n\n     The Law Division judge concluded \"it is clear that the defendant, pursuant\n\nto our statutes, w[as] operating a motor vehicle pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:4 -50.\"\n\nThe judge acknowledged that the officers' prior observations and \"knowledge\n\n. . . [obtained] approximately two to three hours before the motor vehicle stop\"\n\nwas indicative that defendant had been \"under the influence.\" Although the\n\ncourt acknowledged that some of defendant's symptoms were \"consistent with\n\nan individual who had recently awakened,\" it ultimately found that this did \"not\n\n\n4\n   Defendant does not dispute on appeal this finding of \"operation\" under\nN.J.S.A. 39:4-50.\n\n\n                                                                              A-3722-23\n                                         8\n\fexplain the totality of the circumstances, specifically the odor of the alcoholic\n\nbeverage emanating\" from defendant, or defendant's \"swaying\" and \"inability to\n\nstand.\"\n\n    Accordingly, the Law Division judge specifically found that \"reasonable\n\nsuspicion existed at the time of the motor vehicle stop to conduct the field\n\nsobriety test.\" However, as we will discuss, the Law Division judge did not\n\naddress whether the police had a constitutional justification to make the motor\n\nvehicle stop, apart from the alleged community caretaking function. 5\n\n    Before us, defendant presents the following arguments in his appellate\n\nbrief, which are confined to the legality of the motor vehicle stop:\n\n            POINT I\n\n            THE COMMUNITY CARETAKING DOCTRINE\n            WAS INAPPLICABLE BECAUSE THE MOTOR\n            VEHICLE STOP WAS TETHERED TO AN\n            INVESTIGATORY PURPOSE.\n\n            POINT II\n\n            THE OFFICERS DID NOT HAVE REASONABLE\n            SUSPICION TO CONDUCT THE MOTOR VEHICLE\n            STOP (Not Raised Below).\n\n\n5\n   In the \"Motor Vehicles and Traffic Regulation Act,\" N.J.S.A. 39:1-1, \"stop\"\nis defined as \"'Stop,' when required, means complete cessation from movement.\"\nIn the present context, we construe the term to encompass the officers' approach\nto, and apprehension of, the vehicle.\n                                                                           A-3722-23\n                                        9\n\f      We evaluate these arguments guided by well-settled principles of\n\nappellate review. In general, we review a trial court's findings of fact and\n\ncredibility assessments with deference, sustaining those findings when they are\n\nbased upon substantial credible evidence in the record. See State v. Locurto,\n\n157 N.J. 463, 471 (1999). However, \"[i]n contrast to the deference . . . owe[d]\n\nto a trial court's factual and credibility findings, [an appellate court] review[s] a\n\ntrial court's legal conclusions de novo.\" State v. Amang, 481 N.J. Super. 355,\n\n374 (App. Div. 2025) (citing State v. S.S., 229 N.J. 360, 380 (2017)). A\n\nreviewing court is not compelled to adopt the trial court's \"legal conclusions or\n\ninterpretation of the legal consequences that flow from established facts.\" State\n\nv. Burns, 462 N.J. Super. 235, 243 (App. Div. 2020) (citing State v. Goodwin,\n\n224 N.J. 102, 110 (2016)).\n\n      With these standards in mind, we turn to defendant's legal challenges to\n\nthe motor vehicle stop.        The Fourth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution and Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution protect\n\ncitizens against unreasonable searches or seizures, subject to eleven \"specific\n\nexceptions.\" State v. Hill, 115 N.J. 169, 173 (1989). Warrantless searches or\n\nseizures are presumptively invalid and are prohibited \"'unless [they] fall[] within\n\none of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement.'\" State v. Wilson,\n\n\n                                                                              A-3722-23\n                                        10\n\f178 N.J. 7, 12 (2003) (quoting State v. Cooke, 163 N.J. 657, 664 (2000)).\n\n      As we noted above, the State relied here on the community caretaking\n\ndoctrine to justify the officers' early-morning interaction with defendant and his\n\nvehicle at his residence.     The \"community caretaking\" doctrine was first\n\nrecognized by the United States Supreme Court in Cady v. Dombrowski, where\n\nthe Court observed that \"[l]ocal police officers . . . engage in what . . . may be\n\ndescribed as community caretaking functions, totally divorced from the\n\ndetection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a\n\ncriminal statute.\" 413 U.S. 433, 441 (1973) (emphasis added). If the elements\n\nof that doctrine are shown, the fruits of an ensuing search and seizure may be\n\nconstitutionally admissible. Id. at 442; see also State v. Mellody, 479 N.J.\n\nSuper. 90, 124-25 (App. Div. 2024).\n\n      Our Supreme Court has likewise recognized that a search or seizure does\n\nnot require there to be a warrant under the community caretaking doctrine, with\n\nthe exception resting upon the non-investigatory functions of police officers in\n\nsafeguarding the public. See State v. Maryland, 167 N.J. 471, 482 (2001).\n\n\"[P]olice officers provide 'a wide range of social services' outside of their\n\ntraditional law enforcement and criminal investigatory roles.\"            State v.\n\nEdmonds, 211 N.J. 117, 141 (2012) (quoting State v. Bogan, 200 N.J. 61, 72\n\n\n                                                                             A-3722-23\n                                       11\n\f(2009)). Based on \"their community-caretaker role, police officers, who act in\n\nan objectively reasonable manner, may check on the welfare or safety of a\n\ncitizen who appears in need of help on the roadway without securing a warrant\n\nor offending the Constitution.\" State v. Scriven, 226 N.J. 20, 38-39 (2016)\n\n(citing State v. Diloreto, 180 N.J. 264, 276 (2004)).\n\n      The Supreme Court has further emphasized that \"the community\n\ncaretaking responsibility must be a real one, and not a pretext to conduct an\n\notherwise unlawful warrantless search\" or investigation. Bogan, 200 N.J. at 77.\n\n\"So long as the police had an independent basis . . . under the community\n\ncaretaking exception that was not a pretext for carrying out an investigatory\n\nsearch,\" New Jersey courts will find the actions of the police to be lawful Id.\n\nIn reviewing citizen-police encounters under the community caretaking\n\nexception, \"courts . . . 'employ a standard of reasonableness to determine the\n\nlawfulness of [the] police conduct.'\" Diloreto, 180 N.J. at 276 (internal citation\n\nomitted).\n\n      Based on our de novo review of the applications of the community\n\ncaretaking doctrine by the municipal and Law Division judges in this case, we\n\nconclude, as a matter of law, that the doctrine does not justify the police officers'\n\nstop of defendant's idling Jeep parked outside of his residence. The officers'\n\n\n                                                                               A-3722-23\n                                        12\n\ftestimony reflects that the police approached the Jeep based on a belief that\n\ndefendant, who had been observed in an intoxicated condition at his house two\n\nor three hours earlier, may have been driving the Jeep in a similar condition\n\nwhen he was spotted on the road at or about 3:08 a.m. by Sergeant Mariani. The\n\nensuing early-morning encounter at defendant's house was manifestly pursued\n\nto determine whether defendant had committed a DWI. As such, the stop was\n\nnot \"totally divorced\" from a criminal or quasi-criminal investigation. Cady,\n\n413 U.S. at 441. Here, the officers' exercise of their community caretaking\n\nfunction was not a \"real one,\" nor was there an \"independent basis\" for returning\n\nto defendant's residence distinct from pursuing the DWI investigation. Bogan,\n\n200 N.J. at 77.\n\n      We note in this regard that there is no evidence defendant was seen in his\n\nJeep weaving, speeding, running a red light or stop sign, traveling in the wrong\n\nlane, or committing any other apparent traffic violation. The officers did not\n\nassert in their testimony that they were concerned about the welfare of\n\ndefendant's cohabitant as a passenger in the Jeep, nor any other person. The\n\npurpose of the stop was clearly to investigate a possible DWI committed by\n\ndefendant.   The rationale and requirements of the community caretaking\n\ndoctrine were not supported here. Hence, the fruits of the stop, including the\n\n\n                                                                           A-3722-23\n                                      13\n\ffield sobriety and Alcotest results, should have been excluded. Cady, 413 U.S.\n\nat 442; see also Mellody, 479 N.J. Super. at 124-25.\n\n      Turning to the second question before us, the State cannot salvage the\n\nvalidity of the motor vehicle stop by now invoking a different exception to the\n\nwarrant requirement.      The State argues that the stop was justified as an\n\n\"investigatory stop\" under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968) and State v.\n\nNishina, 175 N.J. 502, 510-11 (2003), contending the police had a reasonable,\n\narticulable suspicion that defendant had been driving under the influence.\n\nHowever, the State never invoked that exception in the municipal court when\n\nthe record was developed. Although the municipal court and the Law Division\n\njudge found probable cause to proceed with an arrest after the failed field\n\nsobriety testing, neither judge made a finding of reasonable suspicion to conduct\n\nthe motor vehicle stop that proceeded those events. Unfortunately, the courts\n\nskipped ahead in the chronology of events without the necessary constitutional\n\nanalysis of the stop itself.\n\n      We are loathe to permit the State to belatedly identify a different legal\n\nbasis for its arguments of constitutional validity after the case was tried. State\n\nv. Robinson, 200 N.J. 1, 20 (2009). We recognize the Law Division judge found\n\nthat the police had probable cause to administer the SFSTs as well as the\n\n\n                                                                            A-3722-23\n                                       14\n\fAlcotest based on their observations of defendant and the surrounding\n\ncircumstances.    But that finding did not validate, nor even discuss, the\n\nconstitutionality of the motor vehicle stop that preceded the testing.\n\n      Based on these legal conclusions, we reverse defendant's conviction. The\n\nmatter is remanded to the Law Division for the entry of an implementing order.\n\nReversed. We do not retain jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-3722-23\n                                       15\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                 NOT FOR PUBLICATION WITHOUT THE\n                                APPROVAL OF THE APPELLATE DIVISION\n        This opinion shall not &quot;constitute precedent or be binding upon any court .&quot; Although it is posted on the\n     internet, this opinion is binding only on the parties in the case and its use in other cases is limited .

Carroll, Morris County Prosecutor, attorney\n                   for respondent (Robert J. Lombardo, Assistant\n                   Prosecutor, on the brief).\n\nPER CURIAM\n\f      In this driving while intoxicated (&quot;DWI&quot;) case, the State relied on the\n\ncommunity caretaking doctrine to justify the police&#x27;s encounter with defendant\n\nJoseph Blackham and his parked motor vehicle. Because the municipal court\n\nand the Law Division legally erred in finding the elements of community\n\ncaretaking were met here, we reverse defendant&#x27;s DWI conviction.\n\n      The record reflects the following relevant facts and circumstances. At\n\napproximately midnight on June 14, 2021, four police officers were dispatched\n\nto defendant&#x27;s residence in Netcong to respond to what was described as &quot;a\n\nverbal dispute.&quot; The dispatched officers included Officers Daniel LaManna and\n\nRichard Barbini of the Netcong Borough Police Department and Sergeant Guy\n\nMariani of the Byram Township Police Department, along with an additional\n\nofficer from a different department.\n\n      The officers found at the residence two persons involved in the verbal\n\ndispute: defendant and an adult woman (&quot;the cohabitant&quot;) who reportedly had\n\nbeen living with defendant for about eleven years as of the incident. According\n\nto Officer LaManna&#x27;s testimony at the municipal trial, both defendant and the\n\ncohabitant &quot;explained that they were drinking that evening.&quot; As described by\n\nLaManna, defendant exhibited slurred speech and had &quot;the odor of [an] alcoholic\n\nbeverage,&quot; causing LaManna to perceive that defendant was then intoxicated.\n\n\n                                                                         A-3722-23\n                                       2\n\f         Eventually, the verbal dispute was resolved, with the cohabitant &quot;walking\n\naway&quot; after the officers suggested she do so to de-escalate the situation. The\n\npolice then left the residence without issuing any summonses or taking further\n\naction.\n\n         Later that night, at 3:08 a.m., Sergeant Mariana called Officer LaManna\n\non his cell phone and told LaManna that he had just seen defendant driving a\n\nvehicle. Specifically, the sergeant reported that he had seen the cohabitant\n\n&quot;walking across Route 46 at the time, [and] get picked up in a green Jeep.&quot;\n\nBased on LaManna&#x27;s knowledge &quot;from previous calls,&quot; he recognized the Jeep\n\nas a vehicle that defendant and the cohabitant shared.\n\n         Prompted by the sergeant&#x27;s phone call, Officer LaManna then drove to\n\ndefendant\u2019s residence and observed a green Jeep parked in front of his house.\n\nAs recounted by LaManna, the Jeep &quot;was still running with the lights on, and\n\n[the cohabitant] was in the passenger seat and [defendant] was in the driver&#x27;s\n\nseat.&quot;\n\n         After Officer LaManna activated his squad car&#x27;s lights, the Jeep&#x27;s ignition\n\ngot turned off, and both defendant and the cohabitant allegedly &quot;jumped out of\n\nthe car.&quot; Defendant went towards the Jeep&#x27;s trunk and announced to LaManna\n\nthat he was closing it.\n\n\n                                                                              A-3722-23\n                                          3\n\f      Officer Barbini arrived at the scene shortly thereafter and administered to\n\ndefendant standard field sobriety tests (&quot;SFSTs&quot;). He did so based on Officer\n\nLaManna&#x27;s belief that the tests were appropriate, given &quot;the odor of an alcoholic\n\nbeverage emanating&quot; from defendant&#x27;s breath, his &quot;swaying,&quot; and his &quot;bloodshot\n\nand watery [eyes.]&quot;\n\n      Officer Barbini testified that defendant did not perform the SFSTs in a\n\nsatisfactory manner.1 Consequently, the police transported defendant to the\n\nRoxbury Police Department for an Alcotest.          The Alcotest revealed that\n\ndefendant had a blood alcohol concentration (&quot;BAC&quot;) of 0.13%, above the\n\n0.08% legal limit. Defendant was accordingly charged with a violation of\n\nN.J.S.A 39:4-50.\n\n      In a one-day hearing, the municipal court judge heard testimony from\n\nOfficers LaManna and Barbini for the State, and from the cohabitant for the\n\ndefense. In his oral decision, the municipal court judge upheld the propriety of\n\nthe officers&#x27; actions and found the State had proven defendant&#x27;s guilt.2\n\n\n\n1\n  As the municipal judge noted in his oral opinion, &quot;[D]efendant failed them . . .\n[he] was unable to maintain his balance . . . [or]follow the instructions.&quot;\n2\n A substantial amount of the trial concerned whether the SFSTs and the\nAlcotest had been properly administered, as well as whether defendant&#x27;s BAC\n\n\n                                                                            A-3722-23\n                                        4\n\f      With respect to the police&#x27;s second trip to the residence, the municipal\n\njudge found that &quot;the officers, doing their community caretaking, drove out to\n\nthe site, where they knew . . . there had been drinking earlier.

Brown, self-represented appellant.\n\n                   Theodore N. Stephens, II, Essex County Prosecutor,\n                   attorney for respondent (Frank J. Ducoat, Deputy Chief\n                   Assistant Prosecutor, of counsel and the brief).\n\nPER CURIAM\n\f      Defendant Marvin M. Brown appeals from an October 1, 2024 order\n\ndenying his motion to correct an illegal sentence. We affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n      We previously recounted the facts underlying defendant's conviction in\n\nour decision on defendant's direct appeal, where we remanded for the entry of\n\nan amended judgment of conviction (JOC). State v. Brown, No. A-3156-00\n\n(App. Div. Dec. 12, 2002) (slip op. at 3-5). Therefore, we briefly summarize\n\nonly the facts material to the appeal of the amended JOC before us.\n\n      Defendant was convicted of the following as an accomplice in the 1997\n\nmurder of Terrence Hines: first-degree murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1) and (2);\n\nthird-degree unlawful possession of a handgun, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(b); and\n\nsecond-degree possession of a handgun for an unlawful purpose, N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:39-4(a).   Defendant was also convicted of second-degree conspiracy to\n\ncommit murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 and 2C:11-3.\n\n      The sentencing judge merged the conspiracy and second-degree weapon\n\nconvictions into the murder conviction, for which defendant was sentenced to\n\nan extended term of life imprisonment subject to an eighty-five percent parole\n\ndisqualifier under the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2. The\n\nextended term was mandatorily imposed because defendant had prior Graves\n\n\n                                                                        A-1449-24\n                                      2\n\fAct convictions, N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7(a)(6).1 The sentence for murder was also\n\nsubject to a thirty-five-year parole disqualifier under the Graves Act, N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:43-6(c) and 2C:43-7(a). During sentencing, defense counsel conceded the\n\nGraves Act applied.\n\n      A concurrent five-year term was imposed on the third-degree weapons\n\nconviction, and the aggregate sentence was ordered to run consecutively to the\n\nsentence that defendant was serving for federal crimes. Statutory penalties were\n\nalso imposed.\n\n      Defendant appealed his conviction. We vacated the NERA portion of\n\ndefendant's sentence and remanded for entry of an amended JOC. We affirmed\n\nthe conviction \"[i]n all other respects.\" Brown, slip op. at 18. After the amended\n\nJOC was entered, the resultant sentence was life in prison subject to the\n\nremaining thirty-five-year parole disqualifier under the Graves Act.\n\n      In May 2006, defendant filed a post-conviction relief (PCR) petition,\n\nclaiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The PCR judge denied the petition,\n\nconsidering it time-barred under Rule 3:22-12(a). State v. Brown, No. A-5874-\n\n\n\n1\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:43-6(c) renders the extended term mandatory and requires a\nsentence of \"between [thirty-five] years and life imprisonment, of which the\ndefendant shall serve [thirty-five] years before being eligible for parole.\" See\nN.J.S.A. 2C:43-7(a)(6).\n                                                                            A-1449-24\n                                        3\n\f06 (App. Div. Feb. 23, 2009) (slip op. at 1, 15), certif. denied, 199 N.J. 515\n\n(2009).   We affirmed the PCR judge's decision on both substantive and\n\nprocedural grounds.\n\n      In December 2023, defendant moved to correct an illegal sentence,\n\narguing the Graves Act cannot apply where there was no proof defendant had\n\nactual or constructive possession of a qualifying firearm during commission of\n\nthe predicate offense.    Judge John Zunic denied the motion in an order\n\naccompanied by a comprehensive written decision.\n\n      Judge Zunic held that defendants are subject to the Graves Act if they\n\nactually or constructively possessed a qualifying firearm or if they are found\n\nguilty of the predicate offense as an accomplice. Judge Zunic found there was\n\nno direct evidence of defendant's actual possession of the firearm or his intent\n\nto use it unlawfully, but there was \"clear evidence\" of possession and intent\n\n\"implied through the concept of accomplice liability.\"\n\n      On appeal, defendant raises the following issues for our consideration:\n\n            I. THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE\n            MOTION AND MUST BE REMANDED FOR\n            PROPER CONSIDERATION OF ITS MERITS.\n\n            II. THIS MATTER MUST BE REMANDED FOR AN\n            ERLINGER/CARLTON HEARING.\n\n                                      II.\n\n                                                                          A-1449-24\n                                       4\n\f      We review de novo orders concerning motions to modify sentencing\n\ndecisions pursuant to Rule 3:21-10(b) if the issue on appeal is whether the judge\n\napplied the correct legal standard. State v. Drake, 444 N.J. Super. 265, 271\n\n(App. Div. 2016). If the appeal challenges whether the facts presented to the\n\nsentencing judge are sufficient to warrant relief under Rule 3:21-10(b), we apply\n\nan abuse of discretion standard. State v. Arroyo-Nunez, 470 N.J. Super. 351,\n\n376 (App. Div. 2022).\n\n      Rule 3:21-10 provides, in relevant part, that a motion to reduce or change\n\na sentence may be made at any time to \"correct[ ] a sentence not authorized by\n\nlaw including the Code of Criminal Justice.\" R. 3:21-10(b)(5). Further, Rule\n\n3:22-2(c) permits a defendant to seek PCR from an illegal sentence when the\n\ndefendant claims:\n\n                   [i]mposition of sentence [was] in excess of or\n            otherwise not in accordance with the sentence\n            authorized by law if [the claim is] raised together with\n            other grounds cognizable under paragraph (a), (b), or\n            (d) of this rule. Otherwise a claim alleging the\n            imposition of sentence in excess of or otherwise not in\n            accordance with the sentence authorized by law shall\n            be filed pursuant to [Rule] 3:21-10(b)(5).\n\n                                      III.\n\n      Because we discern no error, we affirm the order denying defendant's\n\nmotion substantially for the same reasons expressed in Judge Zunic's written\n\n\n                                                                           A-1449-24\n                                       5\n\fopinion. We add only the following, addressing defendant's new argument that\n\nthe application of the Graves Act to his sentence was illegal under Erlinger v.\n\nUnited States, 602 U.S. 821 (2024), because his sentence relied on facts not\n\ndecided by the jury.\n\n      In Erlinger, the United States Supreme Court held that \"the Fifth and Sixth\n\nAmendments generally guarantee a defendant the right to have a unanimous jury\n\nfind beyond a reasonable doubt any fact that increases his [or her] exposure to\n\npunishment.\" 602 U.S. at 828, 833-34. \"Virtually 'any fact' that 'increase[s] the\n\nprescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed' must be\n\nresolved by a unanimous jury beyond a reasonable doubt (or freely admitted in\n\na guilty plea).\" Id. at 834 (alteration in original) (quoting Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      In State v. Carlton, 480 N.J. Super. 311 (App. Div. 2024), we addressed\n\nthe implication of Erlinger on sentencing under the persistent-offender statute,\n\nN.J.S.A. 2C:44-3(a), not the Graves Act provision at issue here. In Carlton, we\n\nacknowledged that Erlinger precluded a sentencing court from determining the\n\nfactual predicates for consideration of enhanced sentencing under the persistent-\n\noffender statute. Carlton, 480 N.J. Super. at 326. We held \"a unanimous jury\n\nmust find beyond a reasonable doubt that all five of the [required] factual\n\n\n                                                                           A-1449-24\n                                       6\n\fpredicates are present, or the defendant must admit these predicates as part of a\n\nknowing and voluntary waiver of the right to a jury trial with respect to\n\nextended-term eligibility.\" Id. at 328-29.\n\n      Without reaching the merits, we conclude defendant's argument under\n\nErlinger is time-barred.     In Carlton, we concluded that Erlinger applied\n\nretroactively only to pipeline cases addressing the persistent-offender statute,\n\nN.J.S.A. 2C:44-3(a). 480 N.J. Super. at 326-27. The Erlinger Court stated it\n\nrelied on established constitutional principles, 602 U.S. at 838-39, to \"abrogate\n\nNew Jersey Supreme Court precedent that embraced a contrary interpretation of\n\nthe Apprendi doctrine, State v. Pierce, 188 N.J. 155 (2006).\" Carlton, 480 N.J.\n\nSuper. at 316-17.\n\n      We similarly conclude Erlinger should be given only pipeline retroactivity\n\nwere it to apply to N.J.S.A. 2C:44-3(d). The Court has reached a similar\n\nconclusion as to other decisional law affecting sentencing issues. See, e.g., State\n\nv. Natale, 184 N.J. 458, 494 (2005) (affording pipeline retroactivity to Blakely\n\nv. Washington, 524 U.S. 296 (2004)); State v. Grate, 220 N.J. 317, 335 (2015)\n\n(affording pipeline retroactivity to Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. 99\n\n(2013)). Pipeline retroactivity \"best balances principles of fairness and repose,\"\n\nwhile \"[f]ull retroactivity would overwhelm our courts with resentencings and\n\n\n                                                                             A-1449-24\n                                        7\n\fimpose a devastating burden on the judiciary.\"        Natale, 184 N.J. at 494.\n\nBecause defendant's direct appeal was adjudicated on December 12, 2002, when\n\nwe vacated the NERA aspect of his sentence, it was not pending when Erlinger\n\nwas decided. Thus, we decline to consider defendant's arguments because they\n\nare not subject to pipeline retroactivity.\n\n      We have considered all of defendant's arguments on appeal and, to the\n\nextent we have not expressly addressed any of them, we have determined they\n\nare without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. R. 2:11-\n\n3(e)(2).\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-1449-24\n                                         8\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                 NOT FOR PUBLICATION WITHOUT THE\n                                APPROVAL OF THE APPELLATE DIVISION\n        This opinion shall not &quot;constitute precedent or be binding upon any court .&quot; Although it is posted on the\n     internet, this opinion is binding only on the parties in the case and its use in other cases is limited .

Ducoat, Deputy Chief\n                   Assistant Prosecutor, of counsel and the brief).\n\nPER CURIAM\n\f      Defendant Marvin M. Brown appeals from an October 1, 2024 order\n\ndenying his motion to correct an illegal sentence. We affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n      We previously recounted the facts underlying defendant&#x27;s conviction in\n\nour decision on defendant&#x27;s direct appeal, where we remanded for the entry of\n\nan amended judgment of conviction (JOC). State v. Brown, No. A-3156-00\n\n(App. Div. Dec. 12, 2002) (slip op. at 3-5). Therefore, we briefly summarize\n\nonly the facts material to the appeal of the amended JOC before us.\n\n      Defendant was convicted of the following as an accomplice in the 1997\n\nmurder of Terrence Hines: first-degree murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1) and (2);\n\nthird-degree unlawful possession of a handgun, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(b); and\n\nsecond-degree possession of a handgun for an unlawful purpose, N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:39-4(a).   Defendant was also convicted of second-degree conspiracy to\n\ncommit murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 and 2C:11-3.\n\n      The sentencing judge merged the conspiracy and second-degree weapon\n\nconvictions into the murder conviction, for which defendant was sentenced to\n\nan extended term of life imprisonment subject to an eighty-five percent parole\n\ndisqualifier under the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2. The\n\nextended term was mandatorily imposed because defendant had prior Graves\n\n\n                                                                        A-1449-24\n                                      2\n\fAct convictions, N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7(a)(6).1 The sentence for murder was also\n\nsubject to a thirty-five-year parole disqualifier under the Graves Act, N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:43-6(c) and 2C:43-7(a). During sentencing, defense counsel conceded the\n\nGraves Act applied.\n\n      A concurrent five-year term was imposed on the third-degree weapons\n\nconviction, and the aggregate sentence was ordered to run consecutively to the\n\nsentence that defendant was serving for federal crimes. Statutory penalties were\n\nalso imposed.\n\n      Defendant appealed his conviction. We vacated the NERA portion of\n\ndefendant&#x27;s sentence and remanded for entry of an amended JOC. We affirmed\n\nthe conviction &quot;[i]n all other respects.&quot; Brown, slip op. at 18.

We affirmed the PCR judge&#x27;s decision on both substantive and\n\nprocedural grounds.\n\n      In December 2023, defendant moved to correct an illegal sentence,\n\narguing the Graves Act cannot apply where there was no proof defendant had\n\nactual or constructive possession of a qualifying firearm during commission of\n\nthe predicate offense.    Judge John Zunic denied the motion in an order\n\naccompanied by a comprehensive written decision.\n\n      Judge Zunic held that defendants are subject to the Graves Act if they\n\nactually or constructively possessed a qualifying firearm or if they are found\n\nguilty of the predicate offense as an accomplice. Judge Zunic found there was\n\nno direct evidence of defendant&#x27;s actual possession of the firearm or his intent\n\nto use it unlawfully, but there was &quot;clear evidence&quot; of possession and intent\n\n&quot;implied through the concept of accomplice liability.&quot;\n\n      On appeal, defendant raises the following issues for our consideration:\n\n            I.
