UNITED STATES\n\ncertiorari to the united states court of appeals for\n          the district of columbia circuit\n       No. 23\u2013939. Argued April 25, 2024\u2014Decided July 1, 2024\nA federal grand jury indicted former President Donald J. Trump on four\n  counts for conduct that occurred during his Presidency following the\n  November 2020 election. The indictment alleged that after losing that\n  election, Trump conspired to overturn it by spreading knowingly false\n  claims of election fraud to obstruct the collecting, counting, and certify-\n  ing of the election results. Trump moved to dismiss the indictment\n  based on Presidential immunity, arguing that a President has absolute\n  immunity from criminal prosecution for actions performed within the\n  outer perimeter of his offcial responsibilities, and that the indictment's\n  allegations fell within the core of his offcial duties. The District Court\n  denied Trump's motion to dismiss, holding that former Presidents do\n  not possess federal criminal immunity for any acts. The D. C. Circuit\n  affrmed. Both the District Court and the D. C. Circuit declined to de-\nPage        Proof Pending Publication\n  cide whether the indicted conduct involved offcial acts.\nHeld: Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature\n  of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity\n  from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclu-\n  sive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive\n  immunity from prosecution for all his offcial acts. There is no immu-\n  nity for unoffcial acts. Pp. 605\u2013642.\n     (a) This case is the frst criminal prosecution in our Nation's history\n  of a former President for actions taken during his Presidency. Deter-\n  mining whether and under what circumstances such a prosecution may\n  proceed requires careful assessment of the scope of Presidential power\n  under the Constitution. The nature of that power requires that a for-\n  mer President have some immunity from criminal prosecution for offcial\n  acts during his tenure in offce. At least with respect to the President's\n  exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be abso-\n  lute. As for his remaining offcial actions, he is entitled to at least pre-\n  sumptive immunity. Pp. 605\u2013616.\n        (1) Article II of the Constitution vests \u201cexecutive Power\u201d in \u201ca\n  President of the United States of America.\u201d \u00a7 1, cl. 1. The President\n  has duties of \u201cunrivaled gravity and breadth.\u201d Trump v. Vance, 591\n  U. S. 786, 800. His authority to act necessarily \u201cstem[s] either from an\n  act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.\u201d Youngstown Sheet &\n\f594                   TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n  Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585. In the latter case, the Presi-\n  dent's authority is sometimes \u201cconclusive and preclusive.\u201d Id., at 638\n  (Jackson, J., concurring). When the President exercises such authority,\n  Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President's ac-\n  tions. It follows that an Act of Congress\u2014either a specifc one targeted\n  at the President or a generally applicable one\u2014may not criminalize the\n  President's actions within his exclusive constitutional power. Neither\n  may the courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution that examines such\n  Presidential actions. The Court thus concludes that the President is\n  absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for conduct within his ex-\n  clusive sphere of constitutional authority. Pp. 607\u2013609.\n       (2) Not all of the President's offcial acts fall within his \u201cconclusive\n  and preclusive\u201d authority. The reasons that justify the President's ab-\n  solute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts within the scope of\n  his exclusive constitutional authority do not extend to conduct in areas\n  where his authority is shared with Congress. To determine the Presi-\n  dent's immunity in this context, the Court looks primarily to the Fram-\n  ers' design of the Presidency within the separation of powers, precedent\n  on Presidential immunity in the civil context, and criminal cases where a\n  President resisted prosecutorial demands for documents. Pp. 609\u2013610.\n          (i) The Framers designed the Presidency to provide for a \u201cvigor-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n  ous\u201d and \u201cenergetic\u201d Executive. The Federalist No. 70, pp. 471\u2013472 (J.\n  Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). They vested the President with \u201csuper-\n  visory and policy responsibilities of utmost discretion and sensitivity.\u201d\n  Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 750. Appreciating the \u201cunique\n  risks\u201d that arise when the President's energies are diverted by proceed-\n  ings that might render him \u201cunduly cautious in the discharge of his\n  offcial duties,\u201d the Court has recognized Presidential immunities and\n  privileges \u201crooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of\n  powers and supported by our history.\u201d Id., at 749, 751, 752, n. 32. In\n  Fitzgerald, for instance, the Court concluded that a former President is\n  entitled to absolute immunity from \u201cdamages liability for acts within\n  the `outer perimeter' of his offcial responsibility.\u201d Id., at 756. The\n  Court's \u201cdominant concern\u201d was to avoid \u201cdiversion of the President's\n  attention during the decisionmaking process caused by needless worry\n  as to the possibility of damages actions stemming from any particular\n  offcial decision.\u201d Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 694, n. 19.\n     By contrast, when prosecutors have sought evidence from the Presi-\n  dent, the Court has consistently rejected Presidential claims of absolute\n  immunity. During the treason trial of former Vice President Aaron\n  Burr, for instance, Chief Justice Marshall rejected President Thomas\n  Jefferson's claim that the President could not be subjected to a sub-\n  poena. Marshall simultaneously recognized, however, the existence of\n\f                     Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)                     595\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n a \u201cprivilege\u201d to withhold certain \u201coffcial paper[s].\u201d United States v.\n Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 192 (No. 14,694) (CC Va.). And when a subpoena\n issued to President Richard Nixon, the Court rejected his claim of \u201cab-\n solute privilege.\u201d United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 703. But rec-\n ognizing \u201cthe public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or\n harsh opinions in Presidential decisionmaking,\u201d it held that a \u201cpresump-\n tive privilege\u201d protects Presidential communications. Id., at 708. Be-\n cause that privilege \u201crelates to the effective discharge of a President's\n powers,\u201d id., at 711, the Court deemed it \u201cfundamental to the operation\n of Government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers\n under the Constitution,\u201d id., at 708. Pp. 610\u2013613.\n         (ii) Criminally prosecuting a President for offcial conduct un-\n doubtedly poses a far greater threat of intrusion on the authority and\n functions of the Executive Branch than simply seeking evidence in his\n possession. The danger is greater than what led the Court to recognize\n absolute Presidential immunity from civil damages liability\u2014that the\n President would be chilled from taking the \u201cbold and unhesitating ac-\n tion\u201d required of an independent Executive. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at\n 745. Although the President might be exposed to fewer criminal prose-\n cutions than civil damages suits, the threat of trial, judgment, and im-\n prisonment is a far greater deterrent and plainly more likely to distort\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n Presidential decisionmaking than the potential payment of civil dam-\n ages. The hesitation to execute the duties of his offce fearlessly and\n fairly that might result when a President is making decisions under \u201ca\n pall of potential prosecution,\u201d McDonnell v. United States, 579 U. S. 550,\n 575, raises \u201cunique risks to the effective functioning of government,\u201d\n Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 751. But there is also a compelling \u201cpublic\n interest in fair and effective law enforcement.\u201d Vance, 591 U. S., at 808.\n    Taking into account these competing considerations, the Court con-\n cludes that the separation of powers principles explicated in the Court's\n precedent necessitate at least a presumptive immunity from criminal\n prosecution for a President's acts within the outer perimeter of his off-\n cial responsibility. Such an immunity is required to safeguard the inde-\n pendence and effective functioning of the Executive Branch, and to en-\n able the President to carry out his constitutional duties without undue\n caution. At a minimum, the President must be immune from prosecu-\n tion for an offcial act unless the Government can show that applying a\n criminal prohibition to that act would pose no \u201cdangers of intrusion on\n the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457\n U. S., at 754. Pp. 613\u2013615.\n      (3) As for a President's unoffcial acts, there is no immunity. Al-\n though Presidential immunity is required for offcial actions to ensure\n that the President's decisionmaking is not distorted by the threat of\n\f596                   TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  future litigation stemming from those actions, that concern does not\n  support immunity for unoffcial conduct. Clinton, 520 U. S., at 694,\n  and n. 19. The separation of powers does not bar a prosecution predi-\n  cated on the President's unoffcial acts. Pp. 615\u2013616.\n     (b) The frst step in deciding whether a former President is entitled\n  to immunity from a particular prosecution is to distinguish his offcial\n  from unoffcial actions. In this case, no court thus far has drawn that\n  distinction, in general or with respect to the conduct alleged in particu-\n  lar. It is therefore incumbent upon the Court to be mindful that it is\n  \u201ca court of fnal review and not frst view.\u201d Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566\n  U. S. 189, 201. Critical threshold issues in this case are how to differen-\n  tiate between a President's offcial and unoffcial actions, and how to do\n  so with respect to the indictment's extensive and detailed allegations\n  covering a broad range of conduct. The Court offers guidance on those\n  issues. Pp. 616\u2013632.\n       (1) When the President acts pursuant to \u201cconstitutional and statu-\n  tory authority,\u201d he takes offcial action to perform the functions of his\n  offce. Fitzgerald, 456 U. S., at 757. Determining whether an action is\n  covered by immunity thus begins with assessing the President's author-\n  ity to take that action. But the breadth of the President's \u201cdiscretion-\n  ary responsibilities\u201d under the Constitution and laws of the United\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n  States frequently makes it \u201cdiffcult to determine which of [his] innu-\n  merable `functions' encompassed a particular action.\u201d Id., at 756. The\n  immunity the Court has recognized therefore extends to the \u201couter pe-\n  rimeter\u201d of the President's offcial responsibilities, covering actions so\n  long as they are \u201cnot manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.\u201d\n  Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC).\n     In dividing offcial from unoffcial conduct, courts may not inquire into\n  the President's motives. Such a \u201chighly intrusive\u201d inquiry would risk\n  exposing even the most obvious instances of offcial conduct to judicial\n  examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose. Fitzgerald,\n  457 U. S., at 756. Nor may courts deem an action unoffcial merely be-\n  cause it allegedly violates a generally applicable law. Otherwise, Presi-\n  dents would be subject to trial on \u201cevery allegation that an action was un-\n  lawful,\u201d depriving immunity of its intended effect. Ibid. Pp. 617\u2013619.\n       (2) With the above principles in mind, the Court turns to the con-\n  duct alleged in the indictment. Certain allegations\u2014such as those in-\n  volving Trump's discussions with the Acting Attorney General\u2014are\n  readily categorized in light of the nature of the President's offcial rela-\n  tionship to the offce held by that individual. Other allegations\u2014such\n  as those involving Trump's interactions with the Vice President, state\n  offcials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general\n  public\u2014present more diffcult questions. Pp. 619\u2013630.\n\f                      Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)                      597\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n        (i) The indictment alleges that as part of their conspiracy to over-\n turn the legitimate results of the 2020 Presidential election, Trump and\n his co-conspirators attempted to leverage the Justice Department's\n power and authority to convince certain States to replace their legiti-\n mate electors with Trump's fraudulent slates of electors. According to\n the indictment, Trump met with the Acting Attorney General and other\n senior Justice Department and White House offcials to discuss investi-\n gating purported election fraud and sending a letter from the Depart-\n ment to those States regarding such fraud. The indictment further al-\n leges that after the Acting Attorney General resisted Trump's requests,\n Trump repeatedly threatened to replace him.\n    The Government does not dispute that the indictment's allegations\n regarding the Justice Department involve Trump's use of offcial power.\n The allegations in fact plainly implicate Trump's \u201cconclusive and preclu-\n sive\u201d authority. The Executive Branch has \u201cexclusive authority and\n absolute discretion\u201d to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecute,\n including with respect to allegations of election crime. Nixon, 418\n U. S., at 693. And the President's \u201cmanagement of the Executive\n Branch\u201d requires him to have \u201cunrestricted power . . . to remove the\n most important of his subordinates\u201d\u2014such as the Attorney General\u2014\n \u201cin their most important duties.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 750. The\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n indictment's allegations that the requested investigations were shams\n or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of ex-\n clusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of\n the Justice Department and its offcials. Because the President can-\n not be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional author-\n ity, Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged con-\n duct involving his discussions with Justice Department offcials.\n Pp. 619\u2013621.\n        (ii) The indictment next alleges that Trump and his co-\n conspirators \u201cattempted to enlist the Vice President to use his ceremo-\n nial role at the January 6 certifcation proceeding to fraudulently alter\n the election results.\u201d App. 187, Indictment \u00b610(d). In particular, the\n indictment alleges several conversations in which Trump pressured the\n Vice President to reject States' legitimate electoral votes or send them\n back to state legislatures for review.\n    Whenever the President and Vice President discuss their offcial re-\n sponsibilities, they engage in offcial conduct. Presiding over the Janu-\n ary 6 certifcation proceeding at which Members of Congress count the\n electoral votes is a constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice Presi-\n dent. Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 3; Amdt. 12; 3 U. S. C. \u00a7 15. The indictment's alle-\n gations that Trump attempted to pressure the Vice President to take\n particular acts in connection with his role at the certifcation proceeding\n\f598                   TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n  thus involve offcial conduct, and Trump is at least presumptively im-\n  mune from prosecution for such conduct.\n     The question then becomes whether that presumption of immunity is\n  rebutted under the circumstances. It is the Government's burden to\n  rebut the presumption of immunity. The Court therefore remands to\n  the District Court to assess in the frst instance whether a prosecution\n  involving Trump's alleged attempts to infuence the Vice President's\n  oversight of the certifcation proceeding would pose any dangers of\n  intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.\n  Pp. 621\u2013625.\n         (iii) The indictment's remaining allegations involve Trump's in-\n  teractions with persons outside the Executive Branch: state offcials,\n  private parties, and the general public. In particular, the indictment\n  alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to convince cer-\n  tain state offcials that election fraud had tainted the popular vote count\n  in their States, and thus electoral votes for Trump's opponent needed to\n  be changed to electoral votes for Trump. After Trump failed to convince\n  those offcials to alter their state processes, he and his co-conspirators al-\n  legedly developed and effectuated a plan to submit fraudulent slates of\n  Presidential electors to obstruct the certifcation proceeding. On\n  Trump's view, the alleged conduct qualifes as offcial because it was\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n  undertaken to ensure the integrity and proper administration of the\n  federal election. As the Government sees it, however, Trump can point\n  to no plausible source of authority enabling the President to take such ac-\n  tions. Determining whose characterization may be correct, and with re-\n  spect to which conduct, requires a fact-specifc analysis of the indictment's\n  extensive and interrelated allegations. The Court accordingly remands\n  to the District Court to determine in the frst instance whether Trump's\n  conduct in this area qualifes as offcial or unoffcial. Pp. 625\u2013628.\n         (iv) The indictment also contains various allegations regarding\n  Trump's conduct in connection with the events of January 6 itself. The\n  alleged conduct largely consists of Trump's communications in the form\n  of Tweets and a public address. The President possesses \u201cextraordi-\n  nary power to speak to his fellow citizens and on their behalf.\u201d Trump\n  v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. 667, 701. So most of a President's public communi-\n  cations are likely to fall comfortably within the outer perimeter of his\n  offcial responsibilities. There may, however, be contexts in which the\n  President speaks in an unoffcial capacity\u2014perhaps as a candidate for\n  offce or party leader. To the extent that may be the case, objective\n  analysis of \u201ccontent, form, and context\u201d will necessarily inform the in-\n  quiry. Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S. 443, 453. Whether the communica-\n  tions alleged in the indictment involve offcial conduct may depend on\n  the content and context of each. This necessarily factbound analysis is\n\f                      Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)                      599\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n best performed initially by the District Court. The Court therefore\n remands to the District Court to determine in the frst instance whether\n this alleged conduct is offcial or unoffcial. Pp. 628\u2013630.\n       (3) Presidents cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they\n are immune from prosecution. On remand, the District Court must\n carefully analyze the indictment's remaining allegations to determine\n whether they too involve conduct for which a President must be immune\n from prosecution. And the parties and the District Court must ensure\n that suffcient allegations support the indictment's charges without such\n conduct. Testimony or private records of the President or his advisers\n probing such conduct may not be admitted as evidence at trial.\n Pp. 630\u2013632.\n    (c) Trump asserts a far broader immunity than the limited one the\n Court recognizes, contending that the indictment must be dismissed be-\n cause the Impeachment Judgment Clause requires that impeachment\n and Senate conviction precede a President's criminal prosecution. But\n the text of the Clause does not address whether and on what conduct a\n President may be prosecuted if he was never impeached and convicted.\n See Art. I, \u00a7 3, cl. 7. Historical evidence likewise lends little support to\n Trump's position. The Federalist Papers on which Trump relies con-\n cerned the checks available against a sitting President; they did not\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n endorse or even consider whether the Impeachment Judgment Clause\n immunizes a former President from prosecution. Transforming the po-\n litical process of impeachment into a necessary step in the enforcement\n of criminal law fnds little support in the text of the Constitution or the\n structure of the Nation's Government. Pp. 632\u2013634.\n    (d) The Government takes a similarly broad view, contending that the\n President enjoys no immunity from criminal prosecution for any action.\n On its view, as-applied challenges in the course of the trial suffce to\n protect Article II interests, and review of a district court's decisions on\n such challenges should be deferred until after trial. But questions\n about whether the President may be held liable for particular actions,\n consistent with the separation of powers, must be addressed at the out-\n set of a proceeding. Even if the President were ultimately not found\n liable for certain offcial actions, the possibility of an extended proceed-\n ing alone may render him \u201cunduly cautious in the discharge of his offcial\n duties.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 32. The Constitution does not\n tolerate such impediments to \u201cthe effective functioning of government.\u201d\n Id., at 751. Pp. 634\u2013637.\n    (e) This case poses a question of lasting signifcance: When may a\n former President be prosecuted for offcial acts taken during his Presi-\n dency? In answering that question, unlike the political branches and\n the public at large, the Court cannot afford to fxate exclusively, or even\n\f600                   TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  primarily, on present exigencies. Enduring separation of powers prin-\n  ciples guide our decision in this case. The President enjoys no immu-\n  nity for his unoffcial acts, and not everything the President does is\n  offcial. The President is not above the law. But under our system of\n  separated powers, the President may not be prosecuted for exercising\n  his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled to at least presumptive\n  immunity from prosecution for his offcial acts. That immunity applies\n  equally to all occupants of the Oval Offce. Pp. 641\u2013642.\n91 F. 4th 1173, vacated and remanded.\n\n  Roberts, C.

We consider the scope\nof a President's immunity from criminal prosecution.\n\n                                   I\n   From January 2017 until January 2021, Donald J. Trump\nserved as President of the United States. On August 1,\n2023, a federal grand jury indicted him on four counts for\nconduct that occurred during his Presidency following the\nNovember 2020 election. The indictment alleged that after\nlosing that election, Trump conspired to overturn it by\nspreading knowingly false claims of election fraud to ob-\nstruct the collecting, counting, and certifying of the election\nresults.\n   According to the indictment, Trump advanced his goal\nthrough five primary means. First, he and his co-\nconspirators \u201cused knowingly false claims of election fraud to\nget state legislators and election offcials to . . . change elec-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ntoral votes for [Trump's] opponent, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., to\nelectoral votes for [Trump].\u201d App. 185, Indictment \u00b610(a).\nSecond, Trump and his co-conspirators \u201corganized fraudulent\nslates of electors in seven targeted states\u201d and \u201ccaused these\nfraudulent electors to transmit their false certifcates to the\nVice President and other government offcials to be counted\nat the certifcation proceeding on January 6.\u201d Id., at 186,\n\u00b610(b). Third, Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to\nuse the Justice Department \u201cto conduct sham election crime\ninvestigations and to send a letter to the targeted states that\nfalsely claimed that the Justice Department had identifed\nsignifcant concerns that may have impacted the election out-\n\nliger III, John S.

Fourth, Trump and his co-\nconspirators attempted to persuade \u201cthe Vice President to\nuse his ceremonial role at the January 6 certifcation pro-\nceeding to fraudulently alter the election results.\u201d Id., at\n187, \u00b610(d). And when that failed, on the morning of Janu-\nary 6, they \u201crepeated knowingly false claims of election fraud\nto gathered supporters, falsely told them that the Vice Presi-\ndent had the authority to and might alter the election re-\nsults, and directed them to the Capitol to obstruct the certi-\nfcation proceeding.\u201d Ibid. Fifth, when \u201ca large and angry\ncrowd . . . violently attacked the Capitol and halted the pro-\nceeding,\u201d Trump and his co-conspirators \u201cexploited the dis-\nruption by redoubling efforts to levy false claims of election\nfraud and convince Members of Congress to further delay\nthe certifcation.\u201d Id., at 187\u2013188, \u00b610(e).\n   Based on this alleged conduct, the indictment charged\nTrump with (1) conspiracy to defraud the United States in\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 371, (2) conspiracy to obstruct an\noffcial proceeding in violation of \u00a7 1512(k), (3) obstruction of\nand attempt to obstruct an offcial proceeding in violation of\n\u00a7 1512(c)(2), \u00a7 2, and (4) conspiracy against rights in violation\nof \u00a7 241.1\n   Trump moved to dismiss the indictment based on Presi-\ndential immunity. In his view, the conduct alleged in the\nindictment, properly characterized, was that while he was\nPresident he (1) \u201cmade public statements about the adminis-\ntration of the federal election\u201d; (2) communicated with senior\nJustice Department offcials \u201cabout investigating election\n\n  1\n    Trump contends that the indictment stretches Section 1512(c)(2) \u201cfar\nbeyond its natural meaning.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 39, n. 4. As we ex-\nplained in Fischer v. United States, Section 1512(c)(2) covers acts that\nimpair \u201cthe availability or integrity for use in an offcial proceeding of\nrecords, documents, objects, or . . . other things used in the proceeding.\u201d\n603 U. S. 480, 498 (2024). If necessary, the District Court should deter-\nmine in the frst instance whether the Section 1512(c)(2) charges may pro-\nceed in light of our decision in Fischer.\n\f604                TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nfraud and about choosing the leadership\u201d of the Department;\n(3) \u201ccommunicated with state offcials about the administra-\ntion of the federal election and their exercise of offcial duties\nwith respect to it\u201d; (4) \u201ccommunicated with the Vice Presi-\ndent\u201d and with \u201cMembers of Congress about the exercise of\ntheir offcial duties regarding the election certifcation\u201d; and\n(5) \u201cauthorized or directed others to organize contingent\nslates of electors in furtherance of his attempts to convince\nthe Vice President to exercise his offcial authority in a man-\nner advocated for by President Trump.\u201d Motion To Dismiss\nIndictment Based on Presidential Immunity in No. 1:23\u2013cr\u2013\n00257 (DC), ECF Doc. 74, p. 9. Trump argued that all of\nthe indictment's allegations fell within the core of his offcial\nduties. Id., at 27. And he contended that a President has\nabsolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions per-\nformed within the outer perimeter of his offcial responsibil-\nities, to ensure that he can undertake the especially sensitive\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nduties of his offce with bold and unhesitating action. Id., at\n14, 24.\n   The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, holding\nthat \u201cformer Presidents do not possess absolute federal crim-\ninal immunity for any acts committed while in offce.\u201d 704\nF. Supp. 3d 196, 220 (DC 2023). The District Court recog-\nnized that the President is immune from damages liability in\ncivil cases, to protect against the chilling effect such expo-\nsure might have on the carrying out of his responsibilities.\nSee Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 749\u2013756 (1982). But\nit reasoned that \u201cthe possibility of vexatious post-Presidency\nlitigation is much reduced in the criminal context\u201d in light\nof \u201c[t]he robust procedural safeguards attendant to federal\ncriminal prosecutions.\u201d 704 F. Supp. 3d, at 213\u2013214. The\nDistrict Court declined to decide whether the indicted con-\nduct involved offcial acts. See id., at 220.\n   The D. C. Circuit affrmed. 91 F. 4th 1173 (2024) (per cu-\nriam). Citing Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803),\nthe court distinguished between two kinds of offcial acts:\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)            605\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscretionary and ministerial. 91 F. 4th, at 1189\u20131190. It\nobserved that \u201calthough discretionary acts are `only politi-\ncally examinable,' the judiciary has the power to hear cases\u201d\ninvolving ministerial acts that an offcer is directed to per-\nform by the legislature. Ibid. (quoting Marbury, 1 Cranch,\nat 166). From this distinction, the D. C. Circuit concluded\nthat the \u201cseparation of powers doctrine, as expounded in\nMarbury and its progeny, necessarily permits the Judiciary\nto oversee the federal criminal prosecution of a former Presi-\ndent for his offcial acts because the fact of the prosecution\nmeans that the former President has allegedly acted in def-\nance of the Congress's laws.\u201d 91 F. 4th, at 1191. In the\ncourt's view, the fact that Trump's actions \u201callegedly violated\ngenerally applicable criminal laws\u201d meant that those actions\n\u201cwere not properly within the scope of his lawful discretion.\u201d\nId., at 1192. The D. C. Circuit thus concluded that Trump\nhad \u201cno structural immunity from the charges in the Indict-\nment.\u201d Ibid. Like the District Court, the D. C. Circuit de-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nclined to analyze the actions described in the indictment to\ndetermine whether they involved offcial acts. See id., at\n1205, n. 14.\n   We granted certiorari to consider the following question:\n\u201cWhether and if so to what extent does a former President\nenjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for\nconduct alleged to involve offcial acts during his tenure in\noffce.\u201d 601 U. S. \u2013\u2013\u2013 (2024).\n\n                                II\n   This case is the frst criminal prosecution in our Nation's\nhistory of a former President for actions taken during his\nPresidency. We are called upon to consider whether and\nunder what circumstances such a prosecution may proceed.\nDoing so requires careful assessment of the scope of Presi-\ndential power under the Constitution. We undertake that\nresponsibility conscious that we must not confuse \u201cthe issue\nof a power's validity with the cause it is invoked to promote,\u201d\n\f606               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbut must instead focus on the \u201cenduring consequences upon\nthe balanced power structure of our Republic.\u201d Youngs-\ntown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 634 (1952)\n(Jackson, J., concurring).\n   The parties before us do not dispute that a former Presi-\ndent can be subject to criminal prosecution for unoffcial acts\ncommitted while in offce. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. They\nalso agree that some of the conduct described in the indict-\nment includes actions taken by Trump in his unoffcial capac-\nity. See id., at 28\u201330, 36\u201337, 124.\n   They disagree, however, about whether a former President\ncan be prosecuted for his offcial actions. Trump contends\nthat just as a President is absolutely immune from civil dam-\nages liability for acts within the outer perimeter of his off-\ncial responsibilities, Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 756, he must be\nabsolutely immune from criminal prosecution for such acts.\nBrief for Petitioner 10. And Trump argues that the bulk\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nof the indictment's allegations involve conduct in his offcial\ncapacity as President. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30\u201332. Al-\nthough the Government agrees that some offcial actions are\nincluded in the indictment's allegations, see id., at 125, it\nmaintains that a former President does not enjoy immunity\nfrom criminal prosecution for any actions, regardless of how\nthey are characterized. See Brief for United States 9.\n   We conclude that under our constitutional structure of sep-\narated powers, the nature of Presidential power requires\nthat a former President have some immunity from criminal\nprosecution for offcial acts during his tenure in offce. At\nleast with respect to the President's exercise of his core con-\nstitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. As for\nhis remaining offcial actions, he is also entitled to immunity.\nAt the current stage of proceedings in this case, however, we\nneed not and do not decide whether that immunity must be\nabsolute, or instead whether a presumptive immunity is\nsuffcient.\n\f                    Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)             607\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n                                 A\n   Article II of the Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he execu-\ntive Power shall be vested in a President of the United\nStates of America.\u201d \u00a7 1, cl. 1. The President's duties are\nof \u201cunrivaled gravity and breadth.\u201d Trump v. Vance, 591\nU. S. 786, 800 (2020). They include, for instance, command-\ning the Armed Forces of the United States; granting re-\nprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States;\nand appointing public ministers and consuls, the Justices of\nthis Court, and Offcers of the United States. See \u00a7 2. He\nalso has important foreign relations responsibilities: making\ntreaties, appointing ambassadors, recognizing foreign gov-\nernments, meeting foreign leaders, overseeing international\ndiplomacy and intelligence gathering, and managing matters\nrelated to terrorism, trade, and immigration. See \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3.\nDomestically, he must \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted,\u201d \u00a7 3, and he bears responsibility for the actions of\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthe many departments and agencies within the Executive\nBranch. He also plays a role in lawmaking by recommend-\ning to Congress the measures he thinks wise and signing\nor vetoing the bills Congress passes. See Art. I, \u00a7 7, cl. 2;\nArt. II, \u00a7 3.\n   No matter the context, the President's authority to act\nnecessarily \u201cstem[s] either from an act of Congress or from\nthe Constitution itself.\u201d Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 585. In\nthe latter case, the President's authority is sometimes \u201ccon-\nclusive and preclusive.\u201d Id., at 638 (Jackson, J., concurring).\nWhen the President exercises such authority, he may act\neven when the measures he takes are \u201cincompatible with the\nexpressed or implied will of Congress.\u201d Id., at 637. The ex-\nclusive constitutional authority of the President \u201cdisabl[es] the\nCongress from acting upon the subject.\u201d Id., at 637\u2013638.\nAnd the courts have \u201cno power to control [the President's] dis-\ncretion\u201d when he acts pursuant to the powers invested exclu-\nsively in him by the Constitution. Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 166.\n\f608               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   If the President claims authority to act but in fact exer-\ncises mere \u201cindividual will\u201d and \u201cauthority without law,\u201d the\ncourts may say so. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 655 (Jack-\nson, J., concurring). In Youngstown, for instance, we held\nthat President Truman exceeded his constitutional authority\nwhen he seized most of the Nation's steel mills. See id., at\n582\u2013589 (majority opinion). But once it is determined that\nthe President acted within the scope of his exclusive author-\nity, his discretion in exercising such authority cannot be sub-\nject to further judicial examination.\n   The Constitution, for example, vests the \u201cPower to Grant\nReprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United\nStates\u201d in the President. Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. During and\nafter the Civil War, President Lincoln, and later President\nJohnson, offered a full pardon, with restoration of property\nrights, to anyone who had \u201cengaged in the rebellion\u201d but\nagreed to take an oath of allegiance to the Union. United\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nStates v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 139\u2013141 (1872). But in 1870,\nCongress enacted a provision that prohibited using the Pres-\nident's pardon as evidence of restoration of property rights.\nId., at 143\u2013144. Chief Justice Chase held the provision un-\nconstitutional because it \u201cimpair[ed] the effect of a pardon,\nand thus infring[ed] the constitutional power of the Execu-\ntive.\u201d Id., at 147. \u201cTo the executive alone is intrusted the\npower of pardon,\u201d and the \u201clegislature cannot change the\neffect of such a pardon any more than the executive can\nchange a law.\u201d Id., at 147\u2013148. The President's authority\nto pardon, in other words, is \u201cconclusive and preclusive,\u201d\n\u201cdisabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.\u201d\nYoungstown, 343 U. S., at 637\u2013638 (Jackson, J., concurring).\n   Some of the President's other constitutional powers also\nft that description. \u201cThe President's power to remove\u2014\nand thus supervise\u2014those who wield executive power on his\nbehalf,\u201d for instance, \u201cfollows from the text of Article II.\u201d\nSeila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,\n591 U. S. 197, 204 (2020). We have thus held that Congress\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)             609\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlacks authority to control the President's \u201cunrestricted\npower of removal\u201d with respect to \u201cexecutive offcers of the\nUnited States whom he has appointed.\u201d Myers v. United\nStates, 272 U. S. 52, 106, 176 (1926); see Youngstown, 343\nU. S., at 638, n. 4 (Jackson, J., concurring) (citing the Presi-\ndent's \u201cexclusive power of removal in executive agencies\u201d as\nan example of \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d constitutional au-\nthority); cf. Seila Law, 591 U. S., at 215 (noting only \u201ctwo\nexceptions to the President's unrestricted removal power\u201d).\nThe power \u201cto control recognition determinations\u201d of foreign\ncountries is likewise an \u201cexclusive power of the President.\u201d\nZivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U. S. 1, 32 (2015). Congressional\ncommands contrary to the President's recognition determi-\nnations are thus invalid. Ibid.\n   Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the\nPresident's actions on subjects within his \u201cconclusive and\npreclusive\u201d constitutional authority. It follows that an Act\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nof Congress\u2014either a specifc one targeted at the President\nor a generally applicable one\u2014may not criminalize the Presi-\ndent's actions within his exclusive constitutional power.\nNeither may the courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution\nthat examines such Presidential actions. We thus conclude\nthat the President is absolutely immune from criminal prose-\ncution for conduct within his exclusive sphere of constitu-\ntional authority.\n                                B\n   But of course not all of the President's offcial acts fall\nwithin his \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d authority. As Justice\nRobert Jackson recognized in Youngstown, the President\nsometimes \u201cacts pursuant to an express or implied authoriza-\ntion of Congress,\u201d or in a \u201czone of twilight\u201d where \u201che and\nCongress may have concurrent authority.\u201d 343 U. S., at 635,\n637 (concurring opinion). The reasons that justify the Presi-\ndent's absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts\nwithin the scope of his exclusive authority therefore do not\n\f610               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nextend to conduct in areas where his authority is shared\nwith Congress.\n   We recognize that only a limited number of our prior deci-\nsions guide determination of the President's immunity in this\ncontext. That is because proceedings directly involving a\nPresident have been uncommon in our Nation, and \u201cdecisions\nof the Court in this area\u201d have accordingly been \u201crare\u201d and\n\u201cepisodic.\u201d Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 661\n(1981). To resolve the matter, therefore, we look primarily\nto the Framers' design of the Presidency within the separa-\ntion of powers, our precedent on Presidential immunity in\nthe civil context, and our criminal cases where a President\nresisted prosecutorial demands for documents.\n\n                               1\n   The President \u201coccupies a unique position in the constitu-\ntional scheme,\u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U.

The Fram-\ners \u201csought to encourage energetic, vigorous, decisive, and\nspeedy execution of the laws by placing in the hands of a\nsingle, constitutionally indispensable, individual the ultimate\nauthority that, in respect to the other branches, the Consti-\ntution divides among many.\u201d Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S.\n681, 712 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). They\n\u201cdeemed an energetic executive essential to `the protection\nof the community against foreign attacks,' `the steady admin-\nistration of the laws,' `the protection of property,' and `the\nsecurity of liberty.' \u201d Seila Law, 591 U.

The purpose of a \u201cvigorous\u201d and \u201cenergetic\u201d Execu-\ntive, they thought, was to ensure \u201cgood government,\u201d for a\n\u201cfeeble executive implies a feeble execution of the govern-\nment.\u201d Id., at 471\u2013472.\n   The Framers accordingly vested the President with \u201csu-\npervisory and policy responsibilities of utmost discretion and\n\f                    Cite as: 603 U.

He must make\n\u201cthe most sensitive and far-reaching decisions entrusted to\nany offcial under our constitutional system.\u201d Id., at 752.\nThere accordingly \u201cexists the greatest public interest\u201d in\nproviding the President with \u201c `the maximum ability to deal\nfearlessly and impartially with' the duties of his offce.\u201d\nIbid. (quoting Ferri v. Ackerman, 444 U. S. 193, 203 (1979)).\nAppreciating the \u201cunique risks to the effective functioning\nof government\u201d that arise when the President's energies are\ndiverted by proceedings that might render him \u201cunduly cau-\ntious in the discharge of his offcial duties,\u201d we have recognized\nPresidential immunities and privileges \u201crooted in the constitu-\ntional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by\nour history.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 749, 751, 752, n. 32.\n   In Nixon v. Fitzgerald, for instance, we recognized that\nas \u201ca functionally mandated incident of [his] unique offce,\u201d\na former President \u201cis entitled to absolute immunity from\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ndamages liability predicated on his offcial acts.\u201d Id., at 749.\nThat case involved a terminated Air Force employee who\nsued former President Richard Nixon for damages, alleg-\ning that Nixon approved an Air Force reorganization that\nwrongfully led to his fring. In holding that Nixon was im-\nmune from that suit, \u201cour dominant concern\u201d was to avoid\n\u201cdiversion of the President's attention during the decision-\nmaking process caused by needless worry as to the possibil-\nity of damages actions stemming from any particular offcial\ndecision.\u201d Clinton, 520 U. S., at 694, n. 19. \u201c[T]he singular\nimportance of the President's duties\u201d implicating \u201cmatters\nlikely to `arouse the most intense feelings,' \u201d coupled with\n\u201cthe sheer prominence of [his] offce,\u201d heightens the prospect\nof private damages suits that would threaten such diversion.\nFitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 751\u2013753 (quoting Pierson v. Ray,\n386 U. S. 547, 554 (1967)). We therefore concluded that the\nPresident must be absolutely immune from \u201cdamages liabil-\nity for acts within the `outer perimeter' of his offcial respon-\nsibility.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 756.\n\f612               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   By contrast, when prosecutors have sought evidence from\nthe President, we have consistently rejected Presidential\nclaims of absolute immunity. For instance, during the trea-\nson trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr, Chief Justice\nMarshall rejected President Thomas Jefferson's claim that\nthe President could not be subjected to a subpoena. Mar-\nshall reasoned that \u201cthe law does not discriminate between\nthe president and a private citizen.\u201d United States v. Burr,\n25 F. Cas. 30, 34 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Burr I). Be-\ncause a President does not \u201cstand exempt from the general\nprovisions of the constitution,\u201d including the Sixth Amend-\nment's guarantee that those accused shall have compulsory\nprocess for obtaining witnesses for their defense, a subpoena\ncould issue. Id., at 33\u201334.\n   Marshall acknowledged, however, the existence of a \u201cprivi-\nlege\u201d to withhold certain \u201coffcial paper[s]\u201d that \u201cought not\non light ground to be forced into public view.\u201d United\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nStates v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 192 (No. 14,694) (CC Va. 1807)\n(Burr II); see also Burr I, 25 F. Cas., at 37 (stating that\nnothing before the court showed that the document in ques-\ntion \u201ccontain[ed] any matter the disclosure of which would\nendanger the public safety\u201d). And he noted that a court\nmay not \u201cbe required to proceed against the president as\nagainst an ordinary individual.\u201d Burr II, 25 F. Cas., at 192.\n   Similarly, when a subpoena issued to President Nixon to\nproduce certain tape recordings and documents relating to\nhis conversations with aides and advisers, this Court re-\njected his claim of \u201cabsolute privilege,\u201d given the \u201cconstitu-\ntional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal\nprosecutions.\u201d United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 703,\n707 (1974). But we simultaneously recognized \u201cthe public\ninterest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opin-\nions in Presidential decisionmaking,\u201d as well as the need to\nprotect \u201ccommunications between high Government offcials\nand those who advise and assist them in the performance of\ntheir manifold duties.\u201d Id., at 705, 708. Because the Presi-\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)            613\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndent's \u201cneed for complete candor and objectivity from advis-\ners calls for great deference from the courts,\u201d we held that\na \u201cpresumptive privilege\u201d protects Presidential communica-\ntions. Id., at 706, 708. That privilege, we explained, \u201cre-\nlates to the effective discharge of a President's powers.\u201d\nId., at 711. We thus deemed it \u201cfundamental to the opera-\ntion of Government and inextricably rooted in the separation\nof powers under the Constitution.\u201d Id., at 708.\n\n                                2\n   Criminally prosecuting a President for offcial conduct un-\ndoubtedly poses a far greater threat of intrusion on the au-\nthority and functions of the Executive Branch than simply\nseeking evidence in his possession, as in Burr and Nixon.\nThe danger is akin to, indeed greater than, what led us to\nrecognize absolute Presidential immunity from civil damages\nliability\u2014that the President would be chilled from taking the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n\u201cbold and unhesitating action\u201d required of an independent\nExecutive. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 745. Although the\nPresident might be exposed to fewer criminal prosecutions\nthan the range of civil damages suits that might be brought\nby various plaintiffs, the threat of trial, judgment, and im-\nprisonment is a far greater deterrent. Potential criminal li-\nability, and the peculiar public opprobrium that attaches to\ncriminal proceedings, are plainly more likely to distort Presi-\ndential decisionmaking than the potential payment of civil\ndamages.\n   The hesitation to execute the duties of his offce fearlessly\nand fairly that might result when a President is making deci-\nsions under \u201ca pall of potential prosecution,\u201d McDonnell v.\nUnited States, 579 U. S. 550, 575 (2016), raises \u201cunique risks\nto the effective functioning of government,\u201d Fitzgerald, 457\nU. S., at 751. A President inclined to take one course of ac-\ntion based on the public interest may instead opt for another,\napprehensive that criminal penalties may befall him upon his\ndeparture from offce. And if a former President's offcial\n\f614               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nacts are routinely subjected to scrutiny in criminal prosecu-\ntions, \u201cthe independence of the Executive Branch\u201d may be\nsignifcantly undermined. Vance, 591 U. S., at 800. The\nFramers' design of the Presidency did not envision such\ncounterproductive burdens on the \u201cvigor[ ]\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d of\nthe Executive. The Federalist No. 70, at 471\u2013472.\n   We must, however, \u201crecognize[ ] the countervailing inter-\nests at stake.\u201d Vance, 591 U. S., at 799. Federal criminal\nlaws seek to redress \u201ca wrong to the public\u201d as a whole, not\njust \u201ca wrong to the individual.\u201d Huntington v. Attrill, 146\nU. S. 657, 668 (1892). There is therefore a compelling \u201cpub-\nlic interest in fair and effective law enforcement.\u201d Vance,\n591 U. S., at 808. The President, charged with enforcing\nfederal criminal laws, is not above them.\n   Chief Justice Marshall's decisions in Burr and our decision\nin Nixon recognized the distinct interests present in crimi-\nnal prosecutions. Although Burr acknowledged that the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nPresident's offcial papers may be privileged and publicly un-\navailable, it did not grant him an absolute exemption from\nresponding to subpoenas. See Burr II, 25 F. Cas., at 192;\nBurr I, 25 F. Cas., at 33\u201334. Nixon likewise recognized a\nstrong protection for the President's confdential communica-\ntions\u2014a \u201cpresumptive privilege\u201d\u2014but it did not entirely ex-\nempt him from providing evidence in criminal proceedings.\n418 U. S., at 708.\n   Taking into account these competing considerations, we\nconclude that the separation of powers principles explicated\nin our precedent necessitate at least a presumptive immu-\nnity from criminal prosecution for a President's acts within\nthe outer perimeter of his offcial responsibility. Such an\nimmunity is required to safeguard the independence and ef-\nfective functioning of the Executive Branch, and to enable\nthe President to carry out his constitutional duties without\nundue caution. Indeed, if presumptive protection for the\nPresident is necessary to enable the \u201ceffective discharge\u201d of\nhis powers when a prosecutor merely seeks evidence of his\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)             615\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\noffcial papers and communications, id., at 711, it is certainly\nnecessary when the prosecutor seeks to charge, try, and im-\nprison the President himself for his offcial actions. At a\nminimum, the President must therefore be immune from\nprosecution for an offcial act unless the Government can\nshow that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would\npose no \u201cdangers of intrusion on the authority and functions\nof the Executive Branch.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 754.\n  But as we explain below, the current stage of the pro-\nceedings in this case does not require us to decide whether\nthis immunity is presumptive or absolute. See Part III\u2013B,\ninfra. Because we need not decide that question today, we\ndo not decide it. \u201c[O]ne case\u201d in more than \u201ctwo centuries\ndoes not afford enough experience\u201d to defnitively and com-\nprehensively determine the President's scope of immunity\nfrom criminal prosecution. Mazars, 591 U. S., at 871.\n\n                           C\nPage     Proof       Pending           Publication\n As for a President's unoffcial acts, there is no immunity.\nThe principles we set out in Clinton v. Jones confrm as\nmuch. When Paula Jones brought a civil lawsuit against\nthen-President Bill Clinton for acts he allegedly committed\nprior to his Presidency, we rejected his argument that he\nenjoyed temporary immunity from the lawsuit while serving\nas President. 520 U. S., at 684. Although Presidential im-\nmunity is required for offcial actions to ensure that the\nPresident's decisionmaking is not distorted by the threat of\nfuture litigation stemming from those actions, that concern\ndoes not support immunity for unoffcial conduct. Id., at\n694, and n. 19. The \u201c `justifying purposes' \u201d of the immunity\nwe recognized in Fitzgerald, and the one we recognize today,\nare not that the President must be immune because he is the\nPresident; rather, they are to ensure that the President can\nundertake his constitutionally designated functions effec-\ntively, free from undue pressures or distortions. 520 U. S.,\nat 694, and n. 19 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 755). \u201c[I]t\n\f616                   TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n[is] the nature of the function performed, not the identity\nof the actor who perform[s] it, that inform[s] our immunity\nanalysis.\u201d Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 229 (1988).\nThe separation of powers does not bar a prosecution predi-\ncated on the President's unoffcial acts.2\n\n                                    III\n   Determining whether a former President is entitled to im-\nmunity from a particular prosecution requires applying the\nprinciples we have laid out to his conduct at issue. The frst\nstep is to distinguish his offcial from unoffcial actions. In\nthis case, however, no court has thus far considered how to\ndraw that distinction, in general or with respect to the con-\nduct alleged in particular.\n   Despite the unprecedented nature of this case, and the\nvery signifcant constitutional questions that it raises, the\nlower courts rendered their decisions on a highly expedited\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nbasis. Because those courts categorically rejected any form\nof Presidential immunity, they did not analyze the conduct\nalleged in the indictment to decide which of it should be cate-\ngorized as offcial and which unoffcial. Neither party has\nbriefed that issue before us (though they discussed it at oral\nargument in response to questions). And like the underly-\ning immunity question, that categorization raises multiple\nunprecedented and momentous questions about the powers\nof the President and the limits of his authority under the\nConstitution. As we have noted, there is little pertinent\nprecedent on those subjects to guide our review of this\ncase\u2014a case that we too are deciding on an expedited basis,\n\n  2\n    Our decision in Clinton permitted claims alleging unoffcial acts to pro-\nceed against the sitting President. See 520 U. S., at 684. In the criminal\ncontext, however, the Justice Department \u201chas long recognized\u201d that \u201cthe\nseparation of powers precludes the criminal prosecution of a sitting Presi-\ndent.\u201d Brief for United States 9 (citing A Sitting President's Amenability\nto Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. OLC 222 (2000); emphasis\ndeleted); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

See 601 U. S., at \u2013\u2013\u2013.\nGiven all these circumstances, it is particularly incumbent\nupon us to be mindful of our frequent admonition that \u201c[o]urs\nis a court of fnal review and not frst view.\u201d Zivotofsky v.\nClinton, 566 U. S. 189, 201 (2012) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Critical threshold issues in this case are how to differenti-\nate between a President's offcial and unoffcial actions, and\nhow to do so with respect to the indictment's extensive and\ndetailed allegations covering a broad range of conduct. We\noffer guidance on those issues below. Certain allegations\u2014\nsuch as those involving Trump's discussions with the Acting\nAttorney General\u2014are readily categorized in light of the na-\nture of the President's offcial relationship to the offce held\nby that individual. Other allegations\u2014such as those involv-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ning Trump's interactions with the Vice President, state off-\ncials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the\ngeneral public\u2014present more diffcult questions. Although\nwe identify several considerations pertinent to classifying\nthose allegations and determining whether they are subject\nto immunity, that analysis ultimately is best left to the lower\ncourts to perform in the frst instance.\n\n                                A\n   Distinguishing the President's offcial actions from his un-\noffcial ones can be diffcult. When the President acts pur-\nsuant to \u201cconstitutional and statutory authority,\u201d he takes\noffcial action to perform the functions of his offce. Fitzger-\nald, 457 U. S., at 757. Determining whether an action is\ncovered by immunity thus begins with assessing the Presi-\ndent's authority to take that action.\n   But the breadth of the President's \u201cdiscretionary responsi-\nbilities\u201d under the Constitution and laws of the United States\n\f618               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cin a broad variety of areas, many of them highly sensitive,\u201d\nfrequently makes it \u201cdiffcult to determine which of [his]\ninnumerable `functions' encompassed a particular action.\u201d\nId., at 756. And some Presidential conduct\u2014for example,\nspeaking to and on behalf of the American people, see Trump\nv. Hawaii, 585 U. S. 667, 701 (2018)\u2014certainly can qualify as\noffcial even when not obviously connected to a particular\nconstitutional or statutory provision. For those reasons, the\nimmunity we have recognized extends to the \u201couter perime-\nter\u201d of the President's offcial responsibilities, covering ac-\ntions so long as they are \u201cnot manifestly or palpably beyond\n[his] authority.\u201d Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F. 4th 1, 13\n(CADC 2023) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U. S., at 755\u2013756 (noting that we have \u201crefused\nto draw functional lines finer than history and reason\nwould support\u201d).\n   In dividing offcial from unoffcial conduct, courts may not\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ninquire into the President's motives. Such an inquiry would\nrisk exposing even the most obvious instances of offcial con-\nduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of im-\nproper purpose, thereby intruding on the Article II interests\nthat immunity seeks to protect. Indeed, \u201c[i]t would seri-\nously cripple the proper and effective administration of pub-\nlic affairs as entrusted to the executive branch of the govern-\nment\u201d if \u201c[i]n exercising the functions of his offce,\u201d the\nPresident was \u201cunder an apprehension that the motives that\ncontrol his offcial conduct may, at any time, become the\nsubject of inquiry.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 745 (quoting\nSpalding v. Vilas, 161 U. S. 483, 498 (1896)). We thus re-\njected such inquiries in Fitzgerald. The plaintiff there con-\ntended that he was dismissed from the Air Force for retalia-\ntory reasons. See 457 U. S., at 733\u2013741, 756. The Air Force\nresponded that the reorganization that led to Fitzgerald's\ndismissal was undertaken to promote effciency. Ibid. Be-\ncause under Fitzgerald's theory \u201can inquiry into the Presi-\ndent's motives could not be avoided,\u201d we rejected the theory,\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)            619\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nobserving that \u201c[i]nquiries of this kind could be highly intru-\nsive.\u201d Id., at 756. \u201c[B]are allegations of malice should not\nsuffce to subject government offcials either to the costs of\ntrial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery.\u201d Har-\nlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 817\u2013818 (1982).\n   Nor may courts deem an action unoffcial merely because it\nallegedly violates a generally applicable law. For instance,\nwhen Fitzgerald contended that his dismissal violated vari-\nous congressional statutes and thus rendered his discharge\n\u201coutside the outer perimeter of [Nixon's] duties,\u201d we re-\njected that contention. 457 U. S., at 756. Otherwise, Presi-\ndents would be subject to trial on \u201cevery allegation that an\naction was unlawful,\u201d depriving immunity of its intended ef-\nfect. Ibid.\n                               B\n  With these principles in mind, we turn to the conduct al-\nleged in the indictment.\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n                             1\n   The indictment broadly alleges that Trump and his co-\nconspirators sought to \u201coverturn the legitimate results of the\n2020 presidential election.\u201d App. 183, Indictment \u00b67. It\ncharges that they conspired to obstruct the January 6 con-\ngressional proceeding at which electoral votes are counted\nand certifed, and the winner of the election is certifed as\nPresident-elect. Id., at 181\u2013185, \u00b6\u00b64, 7, 9. As part of\nthis conspiracy, Trump and his co-conspirators allegedly at-\ntempted to leverage the Justice Department's power and au-\nthority to convince certain States to replace their legitimate\nelectors with Trump's fraudulent slates of electors. See id.,\nat 215\u2013220, \u00b6\u00b670\u201385. According to the indictment, Trump\nmet with the Acting Attorney General and other senior Jus-\ntice Department and White House offcials to discuss investi-\ngating purported election fraud and sending a letter from\nthe Department to those States regarding such fraud. See,\ne. g., id., at 217, 219\u2013220, \u00b6\u00b677, 84. The indictment further\n\f620               TRUMP v.

The indictment's allegations\nthat Trump attempted to pressure the Vice President to\ntake particular acts in connection with his role at the certifca-\ntion proceeding thus involve offcial conduct, and Trump is\nat least presumptively immune from prosecution for such\nconduct.\n   The question then becomes whether that presumption of\nimmunity is rebutted under the circumstances.

Rockefeller To Be Vice President Under the Twenty-\nFifth Amendment to the Constitution 2 (Aug. 28, 1974).\nWith respect to the certifcation proceeding in particular,\nCongress has legislated extensively to defne the Vice Presi-\ndent's role in the counting of the electoral votes, see, e. g., 3\nU. S. C. \u00a7 15, and the President plays no direct constitutional\nor statutory role in that process. So the Government may\nargue that consideration of the President's communications\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nwith the Vice President concerning the certifcation proceed-\ning does not pose \u201cdangers of intrusion on the authority and\nfunctions of the Executive Branch.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U.

Applying a criminal prohibition to\nthe President's conversations discussing such matters with\nthe Vice President\u2014even though they concern his role as\nPresident of the Senate\u2014may well hinder the President's\nability to perform his constitutional functions.\n  It is ultimately the Government's burden to rebut the pre-\nsumption of immunity. We therefore remand to the District\nCourt to assess in the frst instance, with appropriate input\nfrom the parties, whether a prosecution involving Trump's\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

Unlike the allegations describing Trump's\ncommunications with the Justice Department and the Vice\nPresident, these remaining allegations involve Trump's in-\nteractions with persons outside the Executive Branch: state\nofficials, private parties, and the general public. Many of\nthe remaining allegations, for instance, cover at great length\nevents arising out of communications that Trump and his co-\nconspirators initiated with state legislators and election offi-\ncials in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wis-\nconsin regarding those States' certification of electors. See\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nApp. 192\u2013207, Indictment \u00b6\u00b613\u201352.\n   Specifcally, the indictment alleges that Trump and his co-\nconspirators attempted to convince those offcials that elec-\ntion fraud had tainted the popular vote count in their States,\nand thus electoral votes for Trump's opponent needed to be\nchanged to electoral votes for Trump. See id., at 185\u2013186,\n\u00b610(a). After Trump failed to convince those offcials to\nalter their state processes, he and his co-conspirators alleg-\nedly developed a plan \u201cto marshal individuals who would\nhave served as [Trump's] electors, had he won the popular\nvote\u201d in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico,\nPennsylvania, and Wisconsin, \u201cand cause those individuals\nto make and send to the Vice President and Congress false\ncertifcations that they were legitimate electors.\u201d Id., at\n208, \u00b653. If the plan worked, \u201cthe submission of these\nfraudulent slates\u201d would position the Vice President to \u201copen\nand count the fraudulent votes\u201d at the certifcation proceed-\ning and set up \u201ca fake controversy that would derail the\nproper certifcation of Biden as president-elect.\u201d Id., at\n\f626                TRUMP v.

See, e. g., id.,\nat 210, 212\u2013213, \u00b6\u00b655, 63. On the same day that the legiti-\nmate electors met in their respective jurisdictions to cast\ntheir votes, the indictment alleges that Trump's \u201cfraudulent\nelectors convened sham proceedings in the seven targeted\nstates to cast fraudulent electoral ballots\u201d in his favor. Id.,\nat 214, \u00b666. Those ballots \u201cwere mailed to the President of\nthe Senate, the Archivist of the United States, and others.\u201d\nIbid., \u00b667.\n   At oral argument, Trump appeared to concede that at least\nsome of these acts\u2014those involving \u201cprivate actors\u201d who\n\u201chelped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of pres-\nidential electors to obstruct the certifcation proceeding\u201d at\nthe direction of Trump and a co-conspirator\u2014entail \u201cpri-\nvate\u201d conduct. Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\u201330. He later asserted,\nhowever, that asking \u201cthe chairwoman of the Republican Na-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ntional Committee . . . to gather electors\u201d qualifes as offcial\nconduct because \u201cthe organization of alternate slates of elec-\ntors is based on, for example, the historical example of Presi-\ndent Grant as something that was done pursuant to and\nancillary and preparatory to the exercise of \u201d a core Presiden-\ntial power. Id., at 37; see also id., at 25 (discussing the \u201chis-\ntorical precedent . . . of President Grant sending federal\ntroops to Louisiana and Mississippi in 1876 to make sure that\nthe Republican electors got certifed in those two cases,\nwhich delivered the election to Rutherford B.

The Government dis-\nagreed, contending that this alleged conduct does not qualify\nas \u201coffcial conduct\u201d but as \u201ccampaign conduct.\u201d Id., at\n124\u2013125.\n   On Trump's view, the alleged conduct qualifes as offcial\nbecause it was undertaken to ensure the integrity and\nproper administration of the federal election. Of course, the\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

And the Presi-\ndent's broad power to speak on matters of public concern\ndoes not exclude his public communications regarding the\nfairness and integrity of federal elections simply because he\nis running for re-election. Cf. Hawaii, 585 U.

In its view,\nTrump can point to no plausible source of authority enabling\nthe President to not only organize alternate slates of electors\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nbut also cause those electors\u2014unapproved by any state off-\ncial\u2014to transmit votes to the President of the Senate for\ncounting at the certifcation proceeding, thus interfering\nwith the votes of States' properly appointed electors. In-\ndeed, the Constitution commits to the States the power to\n\u201cappoint\u201d Presidential electors \u201cin such Manner as the Legis-\nlature thereof may direct.\u201d Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2; see Burroughs\nv. United States, 290 U.

Washington,\n591 U. S. 578, 588\u2013589 (2020). By contrast, the Federal Gov-\nernment's role in appointing electors is limited. Congress\nmay prescribe when the state-appointed electors shall meet,\nand it counts and certifes their votes. Art. II, \u00a7 1, cls. 3, 4.\nThe President, meanwhile, plays no direct role in the proc-\ness, nor does he have authority to control the state offcials\nwho do.

Hamilton); see Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2.\n   Determining whose characterization may be correct, and\nwith respect to which conduct, requires a close analysis of\nthe indictment's extensive and interrelated allegations. See\nApp. 192\u2013215, Indictment \u00b6\u00b613\u201369. Unlike Trump's alleged\ninteractions with the Justice Department, this alleged con-\nduct cannot be neatly categorized as falling within a particu-\nlar Presidential function. The necessary analysis is instead\nfact specifc, requiring assessment of numerous alleged inter-\nactions with a wide variety of state offcials and private per-\nsons. And the parties' brief comments at oral argument in-\ndicate that they starkly disagree on the characterization of\nthese allegations. The concerns we noted at the outset\u2014\nthe expedition of this case, the lack of factual analysis by\nthe lower courts, and the absence of pertinent briefng by\nthe parties\u2014thus become more prominent. We accordingly\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nremand to the District Court to determine in the frst in-\nstance\u2014with the beneft of briefng we lack\u2014whether\nTrump's conduct in this area qualifes as offcial or unoffcial.\n\n                               4\n  Finally, the indictment contains various allegations re-\ngarding Trump's conduct in connection with the events of\nJanuary 6 itself. It alleges that leading up to the January 6\ncertifcation proceeding, Trump issued a series of Tweets (to\nhis nearly 89 million followers) encouraging his supporters\nto travel to Washington, D. C., on that day. See, e. g., App.\n221, 225\u2013227, Indictment \u00b6\u00b687\u201388, 96, 100. Trump and his\nco-conspirators addressed the gathered public that morning,\nasserting that certain States wanted to recertify their elec-\ntoral votes and that the Vice President had the power to\nsend those States' ballots back for recertifcation. Id., at\n228\u2013230, \u00b6\u00b6103\u2013104. Trump then allegedly \u201cdirected the\ncrowd in front of him to go to the Capitol\u201d to pressure the\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)             629\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nVice President to do so at the certifcation proceeding. Id.,\nat 228\u2013230, \u00b6104. When it became public that the Vice Pres-\nident would not use his role at the certifcation proceeding\nto determine which electoral votes should be counted, the\ncrowd gathered at the Capitol \u201cbroke through barriers cor-\ndoning off the Capitol grounds\u201d and eventually \u201cbroke into\nthe building.\u201d Id., at 230\u2013231, \u00b6\u00b6107, 109.\n   The alleged conduct largely consists of Trump's communi-\ncations in the form of Tweets and a public address. The\nPresident possesses \u201cextraordinary power to speak to his fel-\nlow citizens and on their behalf.\u201d Hawaii, 585 U. S., at 701;\ncf. Lindke v. Freed, 601 U. S. 187, 191 (2024). As the sole\nperson charged by the Constitution with executing the laws\nof the United States, the President oversees\u2014and thus will\nfrequently speak publicly about\u2014a vast array of activities\nthat touch on nearly every aspect of American life. Indeed,\na long-recognized aspect of Presidential power is using the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\noffce's \u201cbully pulpit\u201d to persuade Americans, including by\nspeaking forcefully or critically, in ways that the President\nbelieves would advance the public interest. He is even ex-\npected to comment on those matters of public concern that\nmay not directly implicate the activities of the Federal Gov-\nernment\u2014for instance, to comfort the Nation in the wake\nof an emergency or tragedy. For these reasons, most of a\nPresident's public communications are likely to fall comfort-\nably within the outer perimeter of his offcial responsibilities.\n   There may, however, be contexts in which the President,\nnotwithstanding the prominence of his position, speaks in an\nunoffcial capacity\u2014perhaps as a candidate for offce or party\nleader. To the extent that may be the case, objective analy-\nsis of \u201ccontent, form, and context\u201d will necessarily inform the\ninquiry. Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S. 443, 453 (2011) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But \u201cthere is not always a clear\nline between [the President's] personal and offcial affairs.\u201d\nMazars, 591 U. S., at 868. The analysis therefore must be\nfact specifc and may prove to be challenging.\n\f630               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The indictment refects these challenges. It includes only\nselect Tweets and brief snippets of the speech Trump deliv-\nered on the morning of January 6, omitting its full text or\ncontext. See App. 228\u2013230, Indictment \u00b6104. Whether the\nTweets, that speech, and Trump's other communications on\nJanuary 6 involve offcial conduct may depend on the content\nand context of each. Knowing, for instance, what else was\nsaid contemporaneous to the excerpted communications, or\nwho was involved in transmitting the electronic communica-\ntions and in organizing the rally, could be relevant to the\nclassifcation of each communication. This necessarily fact-\nbound analysis is best performed initially by the District\nCourt. We therefore remand to the District Court to deter-\nmine in the frst instance whether this alleged conduct is\noffcial or unoffcial.\n                              C\n   The essence of immunity \u201cis its possessor's entitlement not\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nto have to answer for his conduct\u201d in court. Mitchell, 472\nU. S., at 525. Presidents therefore cannot be indicted based\non conduct for which they are immune from prosecution. As\nwe have explained, the indictment here alleges at least some\nsuch conduct. See Part III\u2013B\u20131, supra. On remand, the\nDistrict Court must carefully analyze the indictment's re-\nmaining allegations to determine whether they too involve\nconduct for which a President must be immune from prosecu-\ntion. And the parties and the District Court must ensure\nthat suffcient allegations support the indictment's charges\nwithout such conduct.\n   The Government does not dispute that if Trump is entitled\nto immunity for certain offcial acts, he may not \u201cbe held\ncriminally liable\u201d based on those acts. Brief for United\nStates 46. But it nevertheless contends that a jury could\n\u201cconsider\u201d evidence concerning the President's offcial acts\n\u201cfor limited and specifed purposes,\u201d and that such evidence\nwould \u201cbe admissible to prove, for example, [Trump's] knowl-\nedge or notice of the falsity of his election-fraud claims.\u201d\n\f                  Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)           631\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 46, 48. That proposal threatens to eviscerate the im-\nmunity we have recognized. It would permit a prosecutor\nto do indirectly what he cannot do directly\u2014invite the jury\nto examine acts for which a President is immune from prose-\ncution to nonetheless prove his liability on any charge. But\n\u201c[t]he Constitution deals with substance, not shadows.\u201d\nCummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 325 (1867). And the\nGovernment's position is untenable in light of the separation\nof powers principles we have outlined.\n  If offcial conduct for which the President is immune may\nbe scrutinized to help secure his conviction, even on charges\nthat purport to be based only on his unoffcial conduct, the\n\u201cintended effect\u201d of immunity would be defeated. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U. S., at 756. The President's immune conduct\nwould be subject to examination by a jury on the basis of\ngenerally applicable criminal laws. Use of evidence about\nsuch conduct, even when an indictment alleges only unoffcial\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nconduct, would thereby heighten the prospect that the Presi-\ndent's offcial decisionmaking will be distorted. See Clin-\nton, 520 U. S., at 694, n. 19.\n  The Government asserts that these weighty concerns can\nbe managed by the District Court through the use of \u201cevi-\ndentiary rulings\u201d and \u201cjury instructions.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 46. But such tools are unlikely to protect adequately\nthe President's constitutional prerogatives. Presidential\nacts frequently deal with \u201cmatters likely to `arouse the most\nintense feelings.' \u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752 (quoting\nPierson, 386 U. S., at 554). Allowing prosecutors to ask or\nsuggest that the jury probe offcial acts for which the Presi-\ndent is immune would thus raise a unique risk that the ju-\nrors' deliberations will be prejudiced by their views of the\nPresident's policies and performance while in offce. The\nprosaic tools on which the Government would have courts\nrely are an inadequate safeguard against the peculiar consti-\ntutional concerns implicated in the prosecution of a former\nPresident. Cf. Nixon, 418 U. S., at 706. Although such\n\f632                   TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntools may suffce to protect the constitutional rights of indi-\nvidual criminal defendants, the interests that underlie Presi-\ndential immunity seek to protect not the President himself,\nbut the institution of the Presidency.3\n                                    IV\n                                    A\n   Trump asserts a far broader immunity than the limited\none we have recognized. He contends that the indictment\nmust be dismissed because the Impeachment Judgment\nClause requires that impeachment and Senate conviction\nprecede a President's criminal prosecution. Brief for Peti-\ntioner 16.\n   The text of the Clause provides little support for such an\nabsolute immunity. It states that an impeachment judg-\nment \u201cshall not extend further than to removal from Offce,\nand disqualifcation to hold and enjoy any Offce of honor,\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nTrust or Proft under the United States.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 3, cl. 7.\nIt then specifes that \u201cthe Party convicted shall nevertheless\nbe liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and\n  3\n    Justice Barrett disagrees, arguing that in a bribery prosecution, for\ninstance, excluding \u201cany mention\u201d of the offcial act associated with the\nbribe \u201cwould hamstring the prosecution.\u201d Post, at 656 (opinion concur-\nring in part); cf. post, at 681\u2013682 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). But of\ncourse the prosecutor may point to the public record to show the fact that\nthe President performed the offcial act. And the prosecutor may admit\nevidence of what the President allegedly demanded, received, accepted, or\nagreed to receive or accept in return for being infuenced in the perform-\nance of the act. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 201(b)(2). What the prosecutor may not\ndo, however, is admit testimony or private records of the President or his\nadvisers probing the offcial act itself. Allowing that sort of evidence\nwould invite the jury to inspect the President's motivations for his offcial\nactions and to second-guess their propriety. As we have explained, such\ninspection would be \u201chighly intrusive\u201d and would \u201c `seriously cripple' \u201d the\nPresident's exercise of his offcial duties. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 745,\n756 (quoting Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U. S. 483, 498 (1896)); see supra, at\n618\u2013619. And such second-guessing would \u201cthreaten the independence or\neffectiveness of the Executive.\u201d Trump v. Vance, 591 U. S. 786, 805 (2020).\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

(emphasis added).\nThe Clause both limits the consequences of an impeachment\njudgment and clarifes that notwithstanding such judgment,\nsubsequent prosecution may proceed. By its own terms, the\nClause does not address whether and on what conduct a\nPresident may be prosecuted if he was never impeached\nand convicted.\n   Historical evidence likewise lends little support to\nTrump's position. For example, Justice Story reasoned that\nwithout the Clause's clarifcation that \u201cIndictment, Trial,\nJudgment and Punishment\u201d may nevertheless follow Senate\nconviction, \u201cit might be matter of extreme doubt, whether\n. . . a second trial for the same offence could be had, either\nafter an acquittal, or a conviction in the court of impeach-\nments.\u201d 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of\nthe United States \u00a7 780, p. 251 (1833). James Wilson, who\nserved on the Committee that drafted the Clause and later\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nas a Justice of this Court, similarly concluded that acquittal\nof impeachment charges posed no bar to subsequent prosecu-\ntion. See 2 Documentary History of the Ratifcation of the\nConstitution 492 (M. Jensen ed. 1976). And contrary to\nTrump's contention, Alexander Hamilton did not disagree.\nThe Federalist Papers on which Trump relies, see Brief for\nPetitioner 17\u201318, concerned the checks available against a\nsitting President. Hamilton noted that unlike \u201cthe King of\nGreat-Britain,\u201d the President \u201cwould be liable to be im-\npeached\u201d and \u201cremoved from offce,\u201d and \u201cwould afterwards\nbe liable to prosecution and punishment.\u201d The Federalist\nNo. 69, at 463; see also id., No. 77, at 520 (explaining that\nthe President is \u201cat all times liable to impeachment, trial,\ndismission from offce . . . and to the forfeiture of life and\nestate by subsequent prosecution\u201d). Hamilton did not en-\ndorse or even consider whether the Impeachment Judgment\nClause immunizes a former President from prosecution.\n   The implication of Trump's theory is that a President who\nevades impeachment for one reason or another during his\n\f634               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nterm in offce can never be held accountable for his criminal\nacts in the ordinary course of law. So if a President man-\nages to conceal certain crimes throughout his Presidency, or\nif Congress is unable to muster the political will to impeach\nthe President for his crimes, then they must forever remain\nimpervious to prosecution.\n   Impeachment is a political process by which Congress can\nremove a President who has committed \u201cTreason, Bribery,\nor other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d Art. II, \u00a7 4.\nTransforming that political process into a necessary step in\nthe enforcement of criminal law fnds little support in the\ntext of the Constitution or the structure of our Government.\n\n                               B\n   The Government for its part takes a similarly broad view,\ncontending that the President enjoys no immunity from\ncriminal prosecution for any action. It maintains this view\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ndespite agreeing with much of our analysis.\n   For instance, the Government does not dispute that Con-\ngress may not criminalize Presidential conduct within the\nPresident's \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d constitutional author-\nity. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 133 (\u201c[C]ore powers . . . can't be\nregulated at all, like the pardon power and veto.\u201d); see also\nid., at 84\u201385. And it too accords protection to Presidential\nconduct if subjecting that conduct to generally applicable\nlaws would \u201craise serious constitutional questions regarding\nthe President's authority\u201d or cause a \u201cpossible confict with\nthe President's constitutional prerogatives.\u201d Application of\n28 U. S. C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal\nJudges, 19 Op. OLC 350, 351\u2013352 (1995); see Brief for United\nStates 26\u201329; Tr. of Oral Arg. 78. Indeed, the Executive\nBranch has long held that view. The Offce of Legal Counsel\nhas recognized, for instance, that a federal statute generally\nprohibiting appointments to \u201c `any offce or duty in any\ncourt' \u201d of persons within certain degrees of consanguinity to\nthe judges of such courts would, if applied to the President,\n\f                    Cite as: 603 U.

OLC, at 350 (quot-\ning 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 458); see 19 Op. OLC, at 350\u2013352. So it\nviewed such a statute as not applying to the President.\nLikewise, it has narrowly construed a criminal prohibition\non grassroots lobbying to avoid the constitutional issues that\nwould otherwise arise, reasoning that the statute should not\n\u201cbe construed to prohibit the President or executive branch\nagencies from engaging in a general open dialogue with the\npublic on the Administration's programs and policies.\u201d Con-\nstraints Imposed by 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1913 on Lobbying Efforts,\n13 Op. OLC 300, 304 (1989); see id., at 304\u2013306.\n   The Government thus broadly agrees that the President's\noffcial acts are entitled to some degree of constitutional pro-\ntection. And with respect to the allegations in the indict-\nment before us, the Government agrees that at least some of\nthe alleged conduct involves offcial acts. See Tr. of Oral\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nArg. 125; cf. id., at 128.\n   Yet the Government contends that the President should\nnot be considered immune from prosecution for those offcial\nacts. See Brief for United States 9. On the Government's\nview, as-applied challenges in the course of the trial suffce\nto protect Article II interests, and review of a district court's\ndecisions on such challenges should be deferred until after\ntrial. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 69, 79\u201380, 154\u2013158. If the Presi-\ndent is instead immune from prosecution, a district court's\ndenial of immunity would be appealable before trial. See\nMitchell, 472 U. S., at 524\u2013530 (explaining that questions of\nimmunity are reviewable before trial because the essence of\nimmunity is the entitlement not to be subject to suit).\n   The Government asserts that the \u201c[r]obust safeguards\u201d\navailable in typical criminal proceedings alleviate the need\nfor pretrial review. Brief for United States 20 (boldface and\nemphasis omitted). First, it points to the Justice Depart-\nment's \u201clongstanding commitment to the impartial enforce-\nment of the law,\u201d id., at 21, as well as the criminal justice\n\f636               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsystem's further protections: grand juries, a defendant's pro-\ncedural rights during trial, and the requirement that the\nGovernment prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, id., at\n22. Next, it contends that \u201cexisting principles of statutory\nconstruction and as-applied constitutional challenges\u201d ade-\nquately address the separation of powers concerns involved\nin applying generally applicable criminal laws to a President.\nId., at 29. Finally, the Government cites certain defenses\nthat would be available to the President in a particular\nprosecution, such as the public-authority defense or the ad-\nvice of the Attorney General. Id., at 29\u201330; see Nardone\nv. United States, 302 U. S. 379, 384 (1937); Tr. of Oral Arg.\n107\u2013108.\n   These safeguards, though important, do not alleviate the\nneed for pretrial review. They fail to address the fact that\nunder our system of separated powers, criminal prohibitions\ncannot apply to certain Presidential conduct to begin with.\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nAs we have explained, when the President acts pursuant to\nhis exclusive constitutional powers, Congress cannot\u2014as a\nstructural matter\u2014regulate such actions, and courts cannot\nreview them. See Part II\u2013A, supra. And he is at least\npresumptively immune from prosecution for his other offcial\nactions. See Part II\u2013B, supra.\n   Questions about whether the President may be held liable\nfor particular actions, consistent with the separation of pow-\ners, must be addressed at the outset of a proceeding. Even\nif the President were ultimately not found liable for certain\noffcial actions, the possibility of an extended proceeding\nalone may render him \u201cunduly cautious in the discharge of\nhis offcial duties.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U.

Nor do we do so today.\n\n                                C\n   As for the dissents, they strike a tone of chilling doom that\nis wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ntoday\u2014conclude that immunity extends to offcial discussions\nbetween the President and his Attorney General, and then re-\nmand to the lower courts to determine \u201cin the frst instance\u201d\nwhether and to what extent Trump's remaining alleged con-\nduct is entitled to immunity. Supra, at 624\u2013625, 628, 630.\n   The principal dissent's starting premise\u2014that unlike\nSpeech and Debate Clause immunity, no constitutional text\nsupports Presidential immunity, see post, at 660\u2013662 (opinion\nof Sotomayor, J.)\u2014is one that the Court rejected decades\nago as \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 750, n. 31;\nsee also Nixon, 418 U. S., at 705\u2013706, n. 16 (rejecting unani-\nmously a similar argument in the analogous executive privi-\nlege context). \u201c[A] specifc textual basis has not been con-\nsidered a prerequisite to the recognition of immunity.\u201d\nFitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 750, n. 31. Nor is that premise cor-\nrect. True, there is no \u201cPresidential immunity clause\u201d in\nthe Constitution. But there is no \u201c `separation of powers\nclause' \u201d either. Seila Law, 591 U. S., at 227. Yet that doc-\n\f638                TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ntrine is undoubtedly carved into the Constitution's text by its\nthree articles separating powers and vesting the Executive\npower solely in the President. See ibid. And the Court's\nprior decisions, such as Nixon and Fitzgerald, have long rec-\nognized that doctrine as mandating certain Presidential priv-\nileges and immunities, even though the Constitution contains\nno explicit \u201cprovision for immunity.\u201d Post, at 660; see Part\nII\u2013B\u20131, supra. Neither the dissents nor the Government\ndisavow any of those prior decisions. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n76\u201377.\n   The principal dissent then cites the Impeachment Judg-\nment Clause, arguing that it \u201cclearly contemplates that a\nformer President may be subject to criminal prosecution.\u201d\nPost, at 661. But that Clause does not indicate whether a\nformer President may, consistent with the separation of pow-\ners, be prosecuted for his offcial conduct in particular. See\nsupra, at 632\u2013633. And the assortment of historical sources\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthe principal dissent cites are unhelpful for the same reason.\nSee post, at 662\u2013664. As the Court has previously noted,\nrelevant historical evidence on the question of Presidential\nimmunity is of a \u201cfragmentary character.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457\nU. S., at 752, n. 31; see also Clinton, 520 U. S., at 696\u2013697; cf.\nYoungstown, 343 U. S., at 634 (Jackson, J., concurring) (not-\ning \u201cthe poverty of really useful and unambiguous authority\napplicable to concrete problems of executive power\u201d).\n\u201c[T]he most compelling arguments,\u201d therefore, \u201carise from\nthe Constitution's separation of powers and the Judiciary's\nhistoric understanding of that doctrine.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457\nU. S., at 752, n. 31.\n   The Court's prior admonition is evident in the principal\ndissent's citations. Some of its cherry-picked sources do not\neven discuss the President in particular. See, e. g., post,\nat 633 (citing 2 Debates on the Constitution 177 (J. Elliot\ned. 1836); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of\nthe United States \u00a7 780, at 250\u2013251).

The principal\ndissent's most compelling piece of evidence consists of ex-\ncerpted statements of Charles Pinckney from an 1800 Senate\ndebate. See post, at 663. But those statements refect only\nthe now-discredited argument that any immunity not ex-\npressly mentioned in the Constitution must not exist. See\n3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 384\u2013385 (M.\nFarrand ed. 1911). And Pinckney is not exactly a reliable\nauthority on the separation of powers: He went on to state\non the same day that \u201cit was wrong to give the nomination\nof Judges to the President\u201d\u2014an opinion expressly rejected\nby the Framers. Id., at 385. Given the Framers' desire for\nan energetic and vigorous President, the principal dissent's\nview that the Constitution they designed allows all his ac-\ntions to be subject to prosecution\u2014even the exercise of\npowers it grants exclusively to him\u2014defes credulity.\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n   Unable to muster any meaningful textual or historical sup-\nport, the principal dissent suggests that there is an \u201cestab-\nlished understanding\u201d that \u201cformer Presidents are answer-\nable to the criminal law for their offcial acts.\u201d Post, at 664.\nConspicuously absent is mention of the fact that since the\nfounding, no President has ever faced criminal charges\u2014\nlet alone for his conduct in offce. And accordingly no court\nhas ever been faced with the question of a President's immu-\nnity from prosecution. All that our Nation's practice estab-\nlishes on the subject is silence.\n   Coming up short on reasoning, the dissents repeatedly\nlevel variations of the accusation that the Court has rendered\nthe President \u201cabove the law.\u201d See, e. g., post, at 657, 659, 667,\n668, 676, 685 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.); post, at 694, 695, 696,\n697, 698, 703 (opinion of Jackson, J.). As before, that \u201crhetor-\nically chilling\u201d contention is \u201cwholly unjustifed.\u201d Fitzger-\nald, 457 U. S., at 758, n. 41. Like everyone else, the President\nis subject to prosecution in his unoffcial capacity. But unlike\nanyone else, the President is a branch of government, and the\n\f640               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nConstitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties. Ac-\ncounting for that reality\u2014and ensuring that the President\nmay exercise those powers forcefully, as the Framers antici-\npated he would\u2014does not place him above the law; it pre-\nserves the basic structure of the Constitution from which\nthat law derives.\n   The dissents' positions in the end boil down to ignoring\nthe Constitution's separation of powers and the Court's prec-\nedent and instead fear mongering on the basis of extreme\nhypotheticals about a future where the President \u201cfeels em-\npowered to violate federal criminal law.\u201d Post, at 673 (opin-\nion of Sotomayor, J.); see post, at 681, 685; post, at 693, 694,\nn. 5, 696, 700, 704\u2013706 (opinion of Jackson, J.). The dissents\noverlook the more likely prospect of an Executive Branch\nthat cannibalizes itself, with each successive President free\nto prosecute his predecessors, yet unable to boldly and fear-\nlessly carry out his duties for fear that he may be next. For\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ninstance, Section 371\u2014which has been charged in this case\u2014\nis a broadly worded criminal statute that can cover \u201c `any\nconspiracy for the purpose of impairing, obstructing or de-\nfeating the lawful function of any department of Govern-\nment.' \u201d United States v. Johnson, 383 U. S. 169, 172 (1966)\n(quoting Haas v. Henkel, 216 U. S. 462, 479 (1910)). Virtu-\nally every President is criticized for insuffciently enforcing\nsome aspect of federal law (such as drug, gun, immigration,\nor environmental laws). An enterprising prosecutor in a\nnew administration may assert that a previous President vi-\nolated that broad statute. Without immunity, such types of\nprosecutions of ex-Presidents could quickly become routine.\nThe enfeebling of the Presidency and our Government that\nwould result from such a cycle of factional strife is exactly\nwhat the Framers intended to avoid. Ignoring those risks,\nthe dissents are instead content to leave the preservation of\nour system of separated powers up to the good faith of\nprosecutors.\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

Despite the un-\nprecedented nature of this case, the signifcant constitutional\nquestions that it raises, its expedited treatment in the lower\ncourts and in this Court, the lack of factual analysis in the\nlower courts, and the lack of briefng on how to categorize\nthe conduct alleged, the principal dissent would go ahead and\ndeclare all of it unoffcial.

But Congress may not\ncriminalize the President's conduct in carrying out the re-\nsponsibilities of the Executive Branch under the Constitu-\ntion. And the system of separated powers designed by the\nFramers has always demanded an energetic, independent\nExecutive. The President therefore may not be prosecuted\nfor exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is enti-\ntled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prose-\ncution for all his offcial acts. That immunity applies equally\nto all occupants of the Oval Offce, regardless of politics, pol-\nicy, or party.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit\nis vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

Fortunately, the Constitution does not permit us to\nchart such a dangerous course.

In\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthis case, the Attorney General purported to appoint a pri-\nvate citizen as Special Counsel to prosecute a former Presi-\ndent on behalf of the United States. But, I am not sure that\nany offce for the Special Counsel has been \u201cestablished by\nLaw,\u201d as the Constitution requires. Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. By\nrequiring that Congress create federal offces \u201cby Law,\u201d the\nConstitution imposes an important check against the Presi-\ndent\u2014he cannot create offces at his pleasure. If there is no\nlaw establishing the offce that the Special Counsel occupies,\nthen he cannot proceed with this prosecution. A private cit-\nizen cannot criminally prosecute anyone, let alone a former\nPresident.\n   No former President has faced criminal prosecution for his\nacts while in offce in the more than 200 years since the\nfounding of our country. And, that is so despite numerous\npast Presidents taking actions that many would argue consti-\ntute crimes. If this unprecedented prosecution is to pro-\nceed, it must be conducted by someone duly authorized to do\nso by the American people. The lower courts should thus\n\f644                    TRUMP v.

In fact, one of the grievances\nraised by the American colonists in declaring their independ-\nence was that the King \u201cha[d] erected a multitude of New\nOffces, and sent hither swarms of Offcers to harass our peo-\nple, and eat out their substance.\u201d Declaration of Independ-\nence \u00b612. The Founders thus drafted the Constitution with\n\u201cevidently a great inferiority in the power of the President,\nin this particular, to that of the British king.\u201d The Federal-\nist No. 69, at 421.\n   The Founders broke from the monarchial model by giving\nthe President the power to fll offces (with the Senate's ap-\nproval), but not the power to create offces. They did so\nby \u201cimposing the constitutional requirement that new offcer\npositions be `established by Law' rather than through a\nKing-like custom of the head magistrate unilaterally creating\nnew offces.\u201d Mascott 492\u2013493 (footnote omitted); see also 1\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nAnnals of Cong. 581\u2013582 (1789) (\u201cThe powers relative to of-\nfces are partly Legislative and partly Executive.

By\nkeeping the ability to create offces out of the President's\nhands, the Founders ensured that no President could unilat-\nerally create an army of offcer positions to then fll with his\nsupporters. Instead, our Constitution leaves it in the hands\nof the people's elected representatives to determine whether\nnew executive offces should exist.\n   Longstanding practice from the founding to today com-\nports with this original understanding that Congress must\ncreate offces by law. The First Congress, for instance, rou-\n\f                       Cite as: 603 U.

See, e. g.,\n\u00a7 35, 1 Stat. 92\u201393 (creating the offces of Attorney General\nand U. S.

Still today, Congress creates the offces that the Ex-\necutive Branch may fll. For example, Congress has created\nseveral offces within the Department of Justice, including\nthe offces of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney Gen-\neral, Associate Attorney General, Solicitor General, and As-\nsistant Attorneys General. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 503\u2013506. For\nsome agencies, Congress has also granted the agency head\nthe power to \u201cappoint such offcers and employees . . . as\nare necessary to execute the functions vested in him.\u201d 7\nU. S. C. \u00a7 610(a) (Department of Agriculture); see also, e. g.,\n20 U. S. C. \u00a7 3461 (Department of Education); 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 913\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n(Department of Health and Human Services).\n   In the past, Congress has at times expressly created of-\nfces similar to the position now occupied by the Special\nCounsel. Congress created an offce for a \u201cspecial counsel\u201d\nto investigate the Teapot Dome Scandal and pursue prosecu-\ntions. See ch. 16, 43 Stat. 6. And, a statute provided for\n\u201cthe appointment of an independent counsel\u201d that we ad-\ndressed in Morrison v. Olson. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 592. That\nstatute lapsed, and Congress has not since reauthorized the\nappointment of an independent counsel. See \u00a7 599.2\n   We cannot ignore the importance that the Constitution\nplaces on who creates a federal offce. To guard against tyr-\nanny, the Founders required that a federal offce be \u201cestab-\n\n  2\n    To be sure, a few Presidents have appointed \u201cspecial prosecutors\u201d with-\nout pointing to any express statutory authorization.

If Congress has not reached a consensus\nthat a particular offce should exist, the Executive lacks the\npower to create and fll an offce of his own accord.\n                                   II\n   It is diffcult to see how the Special Counsel has an offce\n\u201cestablished by Law, \u201d as required by the Constitution.\nWhen the Attorney General appointed the Special Counsel,\nhe did not identify any statute that clearly creates such an\noffce. See Dept. of Justice Order No. 5559\u20132022 (Nov. 18,\n2022). Nor did he rely on a statute granting him the author-\nity to appoint offcers as he deems ft, as the heads of some\nother agencies have.3 See supra, at 647. Instead, the At-\ntorney General relied upon several statutes of a general na-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nture. See Order No. 5559\u20132022 (citing 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 509, 510,\n515, 533).\n   None of the statutes cited by the Attorney General ap-\npears to create an offce for the Special Counsel, and espe-\ncially not with the clarity typical of past statutes used for\nthat purpose. See, e. g., 43 Stat. 647 (\u201c[T]he President is\nfurther authorized and directed to appoint . . . special counsel\nwho shall have charge and control of the prosecution of such\nlitigation\u201d). Sections 509 and 510 are generic provisions\nconcerning the functions of the Attorney General and his\nability to delegate authority to \u201cany other offcer, employee,\nor agency.\u201d Section 515 contemplates an \u201cattorney specially\nappointed by the Attorney General under law,\u201d thereby sug-\ngesting that such an attorney's offce must have already been\ncreated by some other law. (Emphasis added.) As for\n  3\n    In fact, Congress gave the Attorney General the power to appoint \u201cad-\nditional offcers . . . as he deems necessary\u201d\u2014but, only for the Bureau of\nPrisons. 18 U. S.

It is unclear whether\nan \u201coffcial\u201d is equivalent to an \u201coffcer\u201d as used by the Con-\nstitution. See Lucia, 585 U. S., at 254\u2013255 (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (considering the meaning of \u201coffcer\u201d). Regard-\nless, this provision would be a curious place for Congress to\nhide the creation of an offce for a Special Counsel. It is\nplaced in a chapter concerning the Federal Bureau of Investi-\ngation (\u00a7\u00a7 531\u2013540d), not the separate chapters concerning\nU. S. Attorneys (\u00a7\u00a7 541\u2013550) or the now-lapsed Independent\nCounsel (\u00a7\u00a7 591\u2013599).4\n   To be sure, the Court gave passing reference to the cited\nstatutes as supporting the appointment of the Special Prose-\ncutor in United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 694 (1974), but\nit provided no analysis of those provisions' text. Perhaps\nthere is an answer for why these statutes create an offce for\nthe Special Counsel. But, before this consequential prose-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ncution proceeds, we should at least provide a fulsome expla-\nnation of why that is so.\n   Even if the Special Counsel has a valid offce, questions\nremain as to whether the Attorney General flled that offce\nin compliance with the Appointments Clause. For example,\nit must be determined whether the Special Counsel is a prin-\ncipal or inferior offcer. If the former, his appointment is\ninvalid because the Special Counsel was not nominated by\nthe President and confrmed by the Senate, as principal off-\ncers must be. Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. Even if he is an inferior\noffcer, the Attorney General could appoint him without\nPresidential nomination and senatorial confrmation only if\n\u201cCongress . . . by law vest[ed] the Appointment\u201d in the At-\ntorney General as a \u201cHea[d] of Departmen[t].\u201d Ibid. So, the\nSpecial Counsel's appointment is invalid unless a statute cre-\n  4\n   Regulations remain on the books that contemplate an \u201coutside\u201d Special\nCounsel, 28 CFR \u00a7 600.1 (2023), but I doubt a regulation can create a fed-\neral offce without underlying statutory authority to do so.\n\f650                TRUMP v.

If Congress has not\nreached a consensus that a particular offce should exist, the\nExecutive lacks the power to unilaterally create and then fll\nthat offce. Given that the Special Counsel purports to\nwield the Executive Branch's power to prosecute, the conse-\nquences are weighty. Our Constitution's separation of pow-\ners, including its separation of the powers to create and fll\noffces, is \u201cthe absolutely central guarantee of a just Govern-\nment\u201d and the liberty that it secures for us all. Morrison,\n487 U. S., at 697 (Scalia, J., dissenting). There is no prosecu-\ntion that can justify imperiling it.\n                            *     *     *\n  In this case, there has been much discussion about ensur-\ning that a President \u201cis not above the law.\u201d But, as the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nCourt explains, the President's immunity from prosecution\nfor his offcial acts is the law.

Respecting the protections\nthat the Constitution provides for the Offce of the Presi-\ndency secures liberty. In that same vein, the Constitution\nalso secures liberty by separating the powers to create and\nfll offces. And, there are serious questions whether the\nAttorney General has violated that structure by creating an\noffce of the Special Counsel that has not been established by\nlaw. Those questions must be answered before this prose-\ncution can proceed.

That said, I\nwould have framed the underlying legal issues differently.\nThe Court describes the President's constitutional protection\nfrom certain prosecutions as an \u201cimmunity.\u201d As I see it,\nthat term is shorthand for two propositions: The President\ncan challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute as\napplied to offcial acts alleged in the indictment, and he can\nobtain interlocutory review of the trial court's ruling.\n   There appears to be substantial agreement on the frst\npoint. Like the Court, the dissenting Justices and the Spe-\ncial Counsel all accept that some prosecutions of a Presi-\ndent's offcial conduct may be unconstitutional. See post, at\n671\u2013672 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.); Brief for United States\n24\u201330. As for interlocutory review, our precedent recog-\nnizes that resolving certain legal issues before trial is neces-\nsary to safeguard important constitutional interests\u2014here,\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nExecutive Branch independence on matters that Article II\nassigns to the President's discretion.\n   Properly conceived, the President's constitutional protec-\ntion from prosecution is narrow. The Court leaves open the\npossibility that the Constitution forbids prosecuting the\nPresident for any offcial conduct, instructing the lower\ncourts to address that question in the frst instance. See\nante, at 614. I would have answered it now. Though I\nagree that a President cannot be held criminally liable for\nconduct within his \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d authority and\nclosely related acts, ante, at 609, the Constitution does not\nvest every exercise of executive power in the President's sole\ndiscretion, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.

Article II\nposes no barrier to prosecution in such cases.\n   I would thus assess the validity of criminal charges predi-\ncated on most offcial acts\u2014i. e., those falling outside of the\nPresident's core executive power\u2014in two steps. The frst\nquestion is whether the relevant criminal statute reaches the\nPresident's offcial conduct. Not every broadly worded stat-\nute does. For example, \u00a7 956 covers conspiracy to murder\nin a foreign country and does not expressly exclude the Pres-\nident's decision to, say, order a hostage rescue mission\nabroad. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 956(a). The underlying murder stat-\nute, however, covers only \u201cunlawful\u201d killings. \u00a7 1111. The\nOffce of Legal Counsel has interpreted that phrase to refect\na public-authority exception for offcial acts involving the\nmilitary and law enforcement. Memorandum from D.

I express no view about the merits of that\ninterpretation, but it shows that the threshold question of\nstatutory interpretation is a nontrivial step.\n   If the statute covers the alleged offcial conduct, the prose-\ncution may proceed only if applying it in the circumstances\nposes no \u201c `dange[r] of intrusion on the authority and func-\ntions of the Executive Branch.' \u201d Ante, at 615 (quoting\nNixon v.

App.\n193. The President has no authority over state legislatures\nor their leadership, so it is hard to see how prosecuting him\nfor crimes committed when dealing with the Arizona House\nSpeaker would unconstitutionally intrude on executive\npower.\n   This two-step analysis\u2014considering frst whether the stat-\nute applies and then whether its application to the particular\nfacts is constitutional\u2014is similar to the approach that the\nSpecial Counsel presses in this Court. Brief for United\nStates 24\u201330. It is also our usual approach to considering\nthe validity of statutes in situations raising a constitutional\nquestion. See, e. g., Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nProtection Bureau, 591 U. S. 197, 213, 229 (2020).3 An im-\n\n   2\n     This analysis is unnecessary for allegations involving the President's\nprivate conduct because the Constitution offers no protection from prose-\ncution of acts taken in a private capacity. Ante, at 615. Sorting private\nfrom offcial conduct sometimes will be diffcult\u2014but not always. Take\nthe President's alleged attempt to organize alternative slates of electors.\nSee, e. g., App. 208. In my view, that conduct is private and therefore not\nentitled to protection. See post, at 682\u2013683 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).\nThe Constitution vests power to appoint Presidential electors in the\nStates. Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2; see also Chiafalo v. Washington, 591 U. S. 578,\n588\u2013589 (2020). And while Congress has a limited role in that process,\nsee Art. II, \u00a7 1, cls. 3\u20134, the President has none. In short, a President\nhas no legal authority\u2014and thus no offcial capacity\u2014to infuence how the\nStates appoint their electors. I see no plausible argument for barring\nprosecution of that alleged conduct.\n   3\n     The Court has sometimes applied an avoidance canon when interpret-\ning a statute that would interfere with the President's prerogatives. See,\ne. g., Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788, 800\u2013801 (1992); Public Citi-\nzen v. Dept. of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 465\u2013467 (1989); see also Sale v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Barrett, J., concurring in part\n\nportant difference in this context is that the President is\nentitled to an interlocutory appeal of the trial court's ruling.\nSee ante, at 636. A criminal defendant in federal court nor-\nmally must wait until after trial to seek review of the trial\ncourt's refusal to dismiss charges. See United States v.\nMacDonald, 435 U. S. 850, 853\u2013854 (1978); see also 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7 3731. But where trial itself threatens certain constitu-\ntional interests, we have treated the trial court's resolution\nof the issue as a \u201cfnal decision\u201d for purposes of appellate\njurisdiction. MacDonald, 435 U. S., at 854\u2013856; see 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7 1291; see also \u00a7 1257.\n   The present circumstances fall squarely within our prece-\ndent authorizing interlocutory review. When a President\nmoves to dismiss an indictment on Article II grounds, he\n\u201cmakes no challenge whatsoever to the merits of the charge\nagainst him.\u201d Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651, 659\n(1977) (allowing interlocutory appeal of rejection of double\njeopardy defense). He instead contests whether the Consti-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ntution allows Congress to criminalize the alleged conduct, a\nquestion that is \u201ccollateral to, and separable from\u201d his guilt\nor innocence. Ibid. Moreover, the President's Executive\nBranch authority \u201cwould be signifcantly undermined if ap-\npellate review\u201d of the constitutional challenge \u201cwere post-\nponed until after conviction and sentence.\u201d Id., at 660; see\nalso Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U.

S. C. \u00a7 458 to Presiden-\ntial Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. OLC 350, 350\u2013357 (1995). In\nmy view, neither canon applies in this circumstance. Courts should in-\nstead determine the statute's ordinary meaning and, if it covers the al-\nleged offcial acts, assess whether prosecution would intrude on the Presi-\ndent's constitutional authority. See Public Citizen, 491 U. S., at 481\u2013482\n(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (declining to apply the avoidance\ncanon and concluding that the Federal Advisory Committee Act is uncon-\nstitutional as applied).\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

The prospect of a trial\ncourt erroneously allowing the prosecution to proceed poses\na unique danger to the \u201cindependence of the Executive\nBranch.\u201d Trump v. Vance, 591 U. S. 786, 800 (2020). As\nthe Court explains, the possibility that the President will be\nmade to defend his offcial conduct before a jury after he\nleaves offce could distort his decisions while in offce. Ante,\nat 613\u2013614, 636. These Article II concerns do not insulate\nthe President from prosecution. But they do justify inter-\nlocutory review of the trial court's fnal decision on the Presi-\ndent's as-applied constitutional challenge. See Helstoski,\n442 U. S., at 507\u2013508; Abney, 431 U. S., at 659\u2013661; see also\nReply Brief for United States in No. 23\u2013624, p. 5 (agreeing\nthat the President \u201chas a right to an interlocutory appeal\nfrom the district court's rejection of his immunity defense\u201d).\n   I understand most of the Court's opinion to be consistent\nwith these views. I do not join Part III\u2013C, however, which\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nholds that the Constitution limits the introduction of pro-\ntected conduct as evidence in a criminal prosecution of a\nPresident, beyond the limits afforded by executive privilege.\nSee ante, at 630\u2013632. I disagree with that holding; on this\nscore, I agree with the dissent. See post, at 681\u2013682 (Soto-\nmayor, J., dissenting). The Constitution does not require\nblinding juries to the circumstances surrounding conduct for\nwhich Presidents can be held liable. Consider a bribery\nprosecution\u2014a charge not at issue here but one that pro-\nvides a useful example. The federal bribery statute forbids\nany public offcial to seek or accept a thing of value \u201cfor or\nbecause of any offcial act.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 201(c). The Con-\nstitution, of course, does not authorize a President to seek or\naccept bribes, so the Government may prosecute him if he\ndoes so. See Art. II, \u00a7 4 (listing \u201cBribery\u201d as an impeacha-\nble offense); see also Memorandum from L. Silberman, Dep-\nuty Atty. Gen., to R. Burress, Offce of the President, Re:\nConfict of Interest Problems Arising Out of the President's\nNomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller To Be Vice President\n\f656               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                  Barrett, J., concurring in part\n\nUnder the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution 5\n(Aug. 28, 1974) (suggesting that the federal bribery statute\napplies to the President). Yet excluding from trial any men-\ntion of the offcial act connected to the bribe would ham-\nstring the prosecution. To make sense of charges alleging\na quid pro quo, the jury must be allowed to hear about both\nthe quid and the quo, even if the quo, standing alone, could\nnot be a basis for the President's criminal liability.\n   I appreciate the Court's concern that allowing into evi-\ndence offcial acts for which the President cannot be held\ncriminally liable may prejudice the jury. Ante, at 631. But\nthe rules of evidence are equipped to handle that concern\non a case-by-case basis. Most importantly, a trial court can\nexclude evidence of the President's protected conduct \u201cif its\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\n. . . unfair prejudice\u201d or \u201cconfusing the issues.\u201d Fed. Rule\nEvid. 403; see also Rule 105 (requiring the court to \u201crestrict\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthe evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accord-\ningly\u201d). The balance is more likely to favor admitting evi-\ndence of an offcial act in a bribery prosecution, for instance,\nthan one in which the protected conduct has little connection\nto the charged offense. And if the evidence comes in, the\ntrial court can instruct the jury to consider it only for lawful\npurposes. See Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206\u2013207\n(1987). I see no need to depart from that familiar and time-\ntested procedure here.\n                           *    *     *\n   The Constitution does not insulate Presidents from crimi-\nnal liability for offcial acts. But any statute regulating the\nexercise of executive power is subject to a constitutional\nchallenge. See, e. g., Collins v. Yellen, 594 U. S. 220, 235\u2013236\n(2021); Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. 189, 192\u2013194 (2012);\nFree Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Over-\nsight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, 487\u2013488 (2010). A criminal statute\nis no exception.

Because our Con-\nstitution does not shield a former President from answering\nfor criminal and treasonous acts, I dissent.\n\n                            I\nPage     Proof      Pending           Publication\n The indictment paints a stark portrait of a President des-\nperate to stay in power.\n   In the weeks leading up to January 6, 2021, then-President\nTrump allegedly \u201cspread lies that there had been outcome-\ndeterminative fraud in the election and that he had actually\nwon,\u201d App. 181, Indictment \u00b62, despite being \u201cnotifed re-\npeatedly\u201d by his closest advisers \u201cthat his claims were un-\ntrue,\u201d id., at 188, \u00b611.\n   When dozens of courts swiftly rejected these claims,\nTrump allegedly \u201cpushed offcials in certain states to ignore\nthe popular vote; disenfranchise millions of voters; dismiss\nlegitimate electors; and ultimately, cause the ascertainment\nof and voting by illegitimate electors\u201d in his favor.

See id.,\nat 208\u2013209, \u00b6\u00b653\u201354.\n   As the date of the certifcation proceeding neared, Trump\nallegedly also sought to \u201cuse the power and authority of the\nJustice Department\u201d to bolster his knowingly false claims of\nelection fraud by initiating \u201csham election crime investiga-\ntions\u201d and sending offcial letters \u201cfalsely claim[ing] that the\nJustice Department had identifed signifcant concerns that\nmay have impacted the election outcome\u201d while \u201cfalsely pre-\nsent[ing] the fraudulent electors as a valid alternative to the\nlegitimate electors.\u201d Id., at 186\u2013187, \u00b610(c).

The\nmajority thinks he should, and so it invents an atextual, ahis-\ntorical, and unjustifable immunity that puts the President\nabove the law.\n   The majority makes three moves that, in effect, completely\ninsulate Presidents from criminal liability. First, the major-\nity creates absolute immunity for the President's exercise of\n\u201ccore constitutional powers.\u201d Ante, at 606. This holding is\nunnecessary on the facts of the indictment, and the majori-\nty's attempt to apply it to the facts expands the concept of\ncore powers beyond any recognizable bounds. In any event,\nit is quickly eclipsed by the second move, which is to create\nexpansive immunity for all \u201coffcial act[s].\u201d Ante, at 615.\nWhether described as presumptive or absolute, under the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nmajority's rule, a President's use of any offcial power for any\npurpose, even the most corrupt, is immune from prosecution.\nThat is just as bad as it sounds, and it is baseless. Finally,\nthe majority declares that evidence concerning acts for\nwhich the President is immune can play no role in any crimi-\nnal prosecution against him. See ante, at 630\u2013632. That\nholding, which will prevent the Government from using a\nPresident's offcial acts to prove knowledge or intent in pros-\necuting private offenses, is nonsensical.\n   Argument by argument, the majority invents immunity\nthrough brute force. Under scrutiny, its arguments crum-\nble. To start, the majority's broad \u201coffcial acts\u201d immu-\nnity is inconsistent with text, history, and established un-\nderstandings of the President's role. See Part III, infra.\nMoreover, it is deeply wrong, even on its own functionalist\nterms. See Part IV, infra. Next, the majority's \u201ccore\u201d im-\nmunity is both unnecessary and misguided. See Part V,\nin fra. Furthermore, the majority's illogical evidentiary\n\f660                TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nholding is unprecedented. See Part VI, infra. Finally, this\nmajority's project will have disastrous consequences for the\nPresidency and for our democracy. See Part VII, infra.\n\n                               III\n   The main takeaway of today's decision is that all of a Pres-\nident's offcial acts, defned without regard to motive or\nintent, are entitled to immunity that is \u201cat least . . . presump-\ntive,\u201d ante, at 614, and quite possibly \u201cabsolute\u201d, ante, at 615.\nWhenever the President wields the enormous power of his\noffce, the majority says, the criminal law (at least presump-\ntively) cannot touch him. This offcial-acts immunity has\n\u201cno frm grounding in constitutional text, history, or prece-\ndent.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization,\n597 U. S. 215, 280 (2022). Indeed, those \u201cstandard grounds\nfor constitutional decisionmaking,\u201d id., at 279, all point in\nthe opposite direction. No matter how you look at it, the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nmajority's offcial-acts immunity is utterly indefensible.\n\n                                A\n   The majority calls for a \u201ccareful assessment of the scope\nof Presidential power under the Constitution.\u201d Ante, at 605.\nFor the majority, that \u201ccareful assessment\u201d does not involve\nthe Constitution's text. I would start there.\n   The Constitution's text contains no provision for immunity\nfrom criminal prosecution for former Presidents. Of course,\n\u201cthe silence of the Constitution on this score is not disposi-\ntive.\u201d United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 706, n. 16\n(1974). Insofar as the majority rails against the notion that\na \u201c `specifc textual basis' \u201d is required, ante, at 637 (quoting\nNixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 750, n. 31 (1982)), it is\nattacking an argument that has not been made here. The\nomission in the text of the Constitution is worth noting, how-\never, for at least three reasons.\n   First, the Framers clearly knew how to provide for immu-\nnity from prosecution. They did provide a narrow immunity\n\f                    Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)              661\n\n                     Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nfor legislators in the Speech or Debate Clause. See Art. I,\n\u00a7 6, cl. 1 (\u201cSenators and Representatives . . . shall in all Cases,\nexcept Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privi-\nleged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of\ntheir respective Houses, and in going to and returning from\nthe same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they\nshall not be questioned in any other Place\u201d). They did not\nextend the same or similar immunity to Presidents.\n   Second, \u201csome state constitutions at the time of the Fram-\ning specifcally provided `express criminal immunities' to sit-\nting governors.\u201d Brief for Scholars of Constitutional Law\nas Amici Curiae 4 (quoting S. Prakash, Prosecuting and\nPunishing Our Presidents, 100 Tex. L. Rev. 55, 69 (2021)).\nThe Framers chose not to include similar language in the\nConstitution to immunize the President. If the Framers\n\u201chad wanted to create some constitutional privilege to shield\nthe President . . . from criminal indictment,\u201d they could have\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ndone so. Memorandum from R. Rotunda to K. Starr re: In-\ndictability of the President 18 (May 13, 1998). They did not.\n   Third, insofar as the Constitution does speak to this ques-\ntion, it actually contemplates some form of criminal liability\nfor former Presidents. The majority correctly re jects\nTrump's argument that a former President cannot be prose-\ncuted unless he has been impeached by the House and con-\nvicted by the Senate for the same conduct. See ante, at\n632\u2013634; Part IV\u2013C, infra. The majority ignores, however,\nthat the Impeachment Judgment Clause cuts against its own\nposition. That Clause presumes the availability of criminal\nprocess as a backstop by establishing that an offcial im-\npeached and convicted by the Senate \u201cshall nevertheless be\nliable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Pun-\nishment, according to Law.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 3, cl. 7 (emphasis\nadded). That Clause clearly contemplates that a former\nPresident may be subject to criminal prosecution for the\nsame conduct that resulted (or could have resulted) in an\nimpeachment judgment\u2014including conduct such as \u201cBrib-\n\f662                  TRUMP v.

II, \u00a7 4, which implicates offcial acts almost by\ndefnition.1\n                             B\n   Aware of its lack of textual support, the majority points\nout that this Court has \u201crecognized Presidential immunities\nand privileges `rooted in the constitutional tradition of the\nseparation of powers and supported by our history.' \u201d Ante,\nat 611 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 749). That is true,\nas far as it goes. Nothing in our history, however, supports\nthe majority's entirely novel immunity from criminal prose-\ncution for offcial acts.\n   The historical evidence that exists on Presidential immu-\nnity from criminal prosecution cuts decisively against it.\nFor instance, Alexander Hamilton wrote that former Presi-\ndents would be \u201cliable to prosecution and punishment in the\nordinary course of law.\u201d The Federalist No. 69, p. 452 (J.\nHarv.

James Wilson\nrecognized that federal offcers who use their offcial powers\nto commit crimes \u201cmay be tried by their country; and if their\ncriminality is established, the law will punish. A grand jury\nmay present, a petty jury may convict, and the judges will\npronounce the punishment.\u201d 2 Debates on the Constitution\n477 (J. Elliot ed. 1836). A few decades later, Justice Story\nevinced the same understanding. He explained that, when\na federal offcial commits a crime in offce, \u201cit is indispensa-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nble, that provision should be made, that the common tribu-\nnals of justice should be at liberty to entertain jurisdiction\nof the offence, for the purpose of inficting the common pun-\nishment applicable to unoffcial offenders.\u201d 2 Commentaries\non the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 780, pp. 250\u2013251\n(1833). Without a criminal trial, he explained, \u201cthe grossest\noffcial offenders might escape without any substantial pun-\nishment, even for crimes, which would subject their fellow\ncitizens to capital punishment.\u201d Id., at 251.\n   This historical evidence reinforces that, from the very be-\nginning, the presumption in this Nation has always been that\n\n  2\n    To note, as the majority does, see ante, at 639, that this Court has\nrecognized civil immunities arguably inconsistent with this view is not to\nsay that Pinckney was wrong about what the Framers had \u201cintended.\u201d\nIndeed, Pinckney's contemporaries shared the same view during the rati-\nfcation debates. See, e. g., 4 Debates on the Constitution 109 (J. Elliot\ned. 1836) (J. Iredell) (\u201cIf the President does a single act by which the\npeople are prejudiced, he is punishable himself. . . . If he commits any\ncrime, he is punishable by the laws of his country\u201d).\n\f664               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nno man is free to fout the criminal law. The majority fails\nto recognize or grapple with the lack of historical evidence\nfor its new immunity. With nothing on its side of the ledger,\nthe most the majority can do is claim that the historical evi-\ndence is a wash. See ante, at 638\u2013639. It claims that the\nCourt previously has described the \u201crelevant historical evi-\ndence on the question of Presidential immunity\u201d as \u201c `frag-\nmentary' \u201d and not worthy of consideration. Ante, at 638\n(quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 31). Yet the Court\nhas described only the evidence regarding \u201cthe President's\nimmunity from damages liability\u201d as \u201cfragmentary.\u201d Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U. S., at 751\u2013752, n. 31 (emphasis added). More-\nover, far from dismissing that evidence as irrelevant, the\nFitzgerald Court was careful to note that \u201c[t]he best histori-\ncal evidence clearly support[ed]\u201d the immunity from dam-\nages liability that it recognized, and it relied in part on that\nhistorical evidence to overcome the lack of any textual basis\nfor its immunity. Id., at 752, n. 31. The majority ignores\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthis reliance. It seems history matters to this Court only\nwhen it is convenient. See, e. g., New York State Rife &\nPistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. 1 (2022); Dobbs, 597\nU. S. 215.\n                               C\n   Our country's history also points to an established under-\nstanding, shared by both Presidents and the Justice Depart-\nment, that former Presidents are answerable to the criminal\nlaw for their offcial acts. Cf. Chiafalo v. Washington, 591\nU. S. 578, 592\u2013593 (2020) (\u201c `Long settled and established\npractice' may have `great weight in a proper interpretation\nof constitutional provisions' \u201d (quoting The Pocket Veto Case,\n279 U. S. 655, 689 (1929))). Consider Watergate, for exam-\nple. After the Watergate tapes revealed President Nixon's\nmisuse of offcial power to obstruct the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation's investigation of the Watergate burglary,\nPresident Ford pardoned Nixon.

Ford, Vol. 1, Sept. 8,\n1974, p. 103 (1975) (granting former President Nixon a \u201cfull,\nfree, and absolute pardon . . . for all offenses against the\nUnited States which he . . . has committed or may have com-\nmitted or taken part in during\u201d his Presidency); R.

See, e. g.,\n1 L. Walsh, Final Report of the Independent Counsel for\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nIran/Contra Matters: Investigations and Prosecutions 445\n(1993) (\u201c[B]ecause a President, and certainly a past Presi-\ndent, is subject to prosecution . . . the conduct of President\nReagan in the Iran/contra matter was reviewed by Inde-\npendent Counsel against the applicable statutes. It was\nconcluded that [his] conduct fell well short of criminality\nwhich could be successfully prosecuted\u201d).\n   Indeed, Trump's own lawyers during his second impeach-\nment trial assured Senators that declining to impeach Trump\nfor his conduct related to January 6 would not leave him \u201cin\nany way above the law.\u201d 2 Proceedings of the U. S. Senate\nin the Impeachment Trial of Donald John Trump, S. Doc. No.\n117\u20132, p. 144 (2021). They insisted that a former President \u201cis\nlike any other citizen and can be tried in a court of law.\u201d Ibid.;\nsee also 1 id., S. Doc. No. 117\u20133, at 339 (Trump's impeachment\ncounsel stating that \u201cno former offceholder is immune\u201d from\nthe judicial process \u201cfor investigation, prosecution, and pun-\nishment\u201d); id., at 322\u2013323 (Trump's impeachment counsel\nstating: \u201cIf my colleagues on this side of the Chamber actu-\n\f666               TRUMP v.

[a]fter he is out of offce, you go and arrest him\u201d).\nNow that Trump is facing criminal charges for those acts,\nthough, the tune has changed. Being treated \u201clike any\nother citizen\u201d no longer seems so appealing.\n   In sum, the majority today endorses an expansive vision\nof Presidential immunity that was never recognized by the\nFounders, any sitting President, the Executive Branch, or\neven President Trump's lawyers, until now. Settled under-\nstandings of the Constitution are of little use to the majority\nin this case, and so it ignores them.\n\n                              IV\n                               A\n   Setting aside this evidence, the majority announces that\nformer Presidents are \u201cabsolute[ly],\u201d ante, at 615, or \u201cat least\n. . . presumptive[ly],\u201d immune from criminal prosecution for\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nall of their offcial acts, ante, at 614 (emphasis omitted). The\nmajority purports to keep us in suspense as to whether this\nimmunity is absolute or presumptive, but it quickly gives up\nthe game. It explains that, \u201c[a]t a minimum, the President\nmust . . . be immune from prosecution for an offcial act un-\nless the Government can show that applying a criminal pro-\nhibition to that act would pose no `dangers of intrusion\non the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.' \u201d\nAnte, at 615 (emphasis added). No dangers, none at all. It\nis hard to imagine a criminal prosecution for a President's\noffcial acts that would pose no dangers of intrusion on Presi-\ndential authority in the majority's eyes. Nor should that be\nthe standard. Surely some intrusions on the Executive may\nbe \u201cjustifed by an overriding need to promote objectives\nwithin the constitutional authority of Congress.\u201d Nixon v.\nAdministrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 443 (1977).\nOther intrusions may be justifed by the \u201cprimary constitu-\ntional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal\nprosecutions.\u201d United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 707\n\f                    Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)             667\n\n                     Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\n(1974). According to the majority, however, any incursion\non Executive power is too much. When presumptive im-\nmunity is this conclusive, the majority's indecision as to\n\u201cwhether [official-acts] immunity must be absolute\u201d or\nwhether, instead, \u201cpresumptive immunity is suffcient,\u201d ante,\nat 606, hardly matters.\n   Maybe some future opinion of this Court will decide that\npresumptive immunity is \u201csuffcient,\u201d ibid., and replace the\nmajority's ironclad presumption with one that makes the dif-\nference between presumptive and absolute immunity mean-\ningful. Today's Court, however, has replaced a presumption\nof equality before the law with a presumption that the Presi-\ndent is above the law for all of his offcial acts.\n   Quick on the heels of announcing this astonishingly broad\noffcial-acts immunity, the majority assures us that a former\nPresident can still be prosecuted for \u201cunoffcial acts.\u201d Ante,\nat 615. Of course he can. No one has questioned the ability\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nto prosecute a former President for unoffcial (otherwise\nknown as private) acts. Even Trump did not claim immu-\nnity for such acts and, as the majority acknowledges, such\nan immunity would be impossible to square with Clinton v.\nJones, 520 U. S. 681 (1997). See ante, at 615. This unre-\nmarkable proposition is no real limit on today's decision. It\ndoes not hide the majority's embrace of the most far-\nreaching view of Presidential immunity on offer.\n   In fact, the majority's dividing line between \u201coffcial\u201d and\n\u201cunoffcial\u201d conduct narrows the conduct considered \u201cunoff-\ncial\u201d almost to a nullity. It says that whenever the Presi-\ndent acts in a way that is \u201c `not manifestly or palpably be-\nyond [his] authority,' \u201d he is taking offcial action. Ante, at\n618 (quoting Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC\n2023)). It then goes a step further: \u201cIn dividing offcial from\nunoffcial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President's\nmotives.\u201d Ante, at 618. It is one thing to say that motive\nis irrelevant to questions regarding the scope of civil liability,\nbut it is quite another to make it irrelevant to questions re-\n\f668                TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\ngarding criminal liability. Under that rule, any use of off-\ncial power for any purpose, even the most corrupt purpose\nindicated by objective evidence of the most corrupt motives\nand intent, remains offcial and immune. Under the majori-\nty's test, if it can be called a test, the category of Presidential\naction that can be deemed \u201cunoffcial\u201d is destined to be van-\nishingly small.\n   Ultimately, the majority pays lip service to the idea that\n\u201c[t]he President, charged with enforcing federal criminal\nlaws, is not above them,\u201d ante, at 614, but it then proceeds\nto place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal\ncriminal laws for any abuse of offcial power.\n\n                                B\n  So how does the majority get to its rule? With text, his-\ntory, and established understanding all weighing against it,\nthe majority claims just one arrow in its quiver: the balanc-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ning test in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731 (1983). Yet\neven that test cuts against it. The majority concludes that\noffcial-acts immunity \u201cis required to safeguard the inde-\npendence and effective functioning of the Executive Branch,\u201d\nante, at 614, by rejecting that Branch's own protestations\nthat such immunity is not at all required and would in fact\nbe harmful, see Brief for United States 18\u201324, 29\u201330. In\ndoing so, it decontextualizes Fitzgerald's language, ignores\nimportant qualifcations, and reaches a result that the Fitz-\ngerald Court never would have countenanced.\n  In Fitzgerald, plaintiff A. Ernest Fitzgerald sued then-\nformer President Nixon for money damages. He claimed\nthat, while in offce, Nixon had been involved in unlawfully\nfring him from his government job. See 457 U. S., at 733\u2013\n741. The question for the Court was whether a former\nPresident had immunity from such a civil suit. The Court\nexplained that it was \u201csettled law that the separation-of-\npowers doctrine does not bar every exercise of jurisdiction\nover the President of the United States.\u201d Id., at 753\u2013754.\nTo determine whether a particular type of suit against a\n\f                    Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)             669\n\n                     Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nPresident (or former President) could be heard, a court\n\u201cmust balance the constitutional weight of the interest to be\nserved against the dangers of intrusion on the authority and\nfunctions of the Executive Branch.\u201d Id., at 754. The Court\nexplained that, \u201c[w]hen judicial action is needed to serve\nbroad public interests,\u2014as when the Court acts, not in dero-\ngation of the separation of powers, but to maintain their\nproper balance, or to vindicate the public interest in an ongo-\ning criminal prosecution\u2014the exercise of jurisdiction has\nbeen held warranted.\u201d Ibid. (citations omitted).\n   On the facts before it, the Court concluded that a \u201cmerely\nprivate suit for damages based on a President's offcial acts\u201d\ndid not serve those interests. Ibid. The Court reasoned\nthat the \u201cvisibility of [the President's] offce and the effect of\nhis actions on countless people\u201d made him an easy target for\ncivil suits that \u201cfrequently could distract [him] from his pub-\nlic duties.\u201d Id., at 753. The public interest in such private\ncivil suits, the Court concluded, was comparatively weak.\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nSee id., at 754, n. 37 (\u201c[T]here is a lesser public interest in\nactions for civil damages than, for example, in criminal\nprosecutions\u201d). Therefore, the Court held that a former\nPresident was immune from such suits. Ibid.\n   In the context of a federal criminal prosecution of a former\nPresident, however, the danger to the functioning of the Exec-\nutive Branch is much reduced. Further, as every member of\nthe Fitzgerald Court acknowledged, see Part IV\u2013B\u20132, infra,\nthe public interest in a criminal prosecution is far weightier.\nApplying the Fitzgerald balancing here should yield the oppo-\nsite result. Instead, the majority elides any difference be-\ntween civil and criminal immunity, granting Trump the same\nimmunity from criminal prosecution that Nixon enjoyed from\nan unlawful termination suit. That is plainly wrong.\n\n                                 1\n  The majority relies almost entirely on its view of the dan-\nger of intrusion on the Executive Branch, to the exclusion of\nthe other side of the balancing test. Its analysis rests on\n\f670                TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\na questionable conception of the President as incapable of\nnavigating the diffcult decisions his job requires while stay-\ning within the bounds of the law. It also ignores the fact\nthat he receives robust legal advice on the lawfulness of his\nactions.\n   The majority says that the danger \u201cof intrusion on the\nauthority and functions of the Executive Branch\u201d posed by\ncriminally prosecuting a former President for offcial conduct\n\u201cis akin to, indeed greater than, what led us to recognize\nabsolute Presidential immunity from civil damages liabil-\nity\u2014that the President would be chilled from taking the\n`bold and unhesitating action' required of an independent Ex-\necutive.\u201d Ante, at 613 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at\n745). It is of course important that the President be able\nto \u201c ` \u201cdeal fearlessly and impartially with\u201d the duties of his\noffce.' \u201d Ante, at 611 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752).\nIf every action the President takes exposes him personally to\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nvexatious private litigation, the possibility of hamstringing\nPresidential decisionmaking is very real. Yet there are\nmany facets of criminal liability, which the majority dis-\ncounts, that make it less likely to chill Presidential action\nthan the threat of civil litigation.\n   First, in terms of probability, the threat of criminal liabil-\nity is much smaller. In Fitzgerald, the threat of vexatious\ncivil litigation loomed large. The Court observed that,\ngiven the \u201cvisibility of his offce and the effect of his actions\non countless people, the President would be an easily identi-\nfable target for suits for civil damages.\u201d Id., at 753. Al-\nthough \u201c `the effect of [the President's] actions on countless\npeople' could result in untold numbers of private plaintiffs\nsuing for damages based on any number of Presidential acts\u201d\nin the civil context, the risk in the criminal context is \u201conly\nthat a former President may face one federal prosecution, in\none jurisdiction, for each criminal offense allegedly com-\nmitted while in offce.\u201d 704 F. Supp. 3d 196, 213 (DC 2023)\n(quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 753). The majority's\n\f                      Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)                 671\n\n                       Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nbare assertion that the burden of exposure to federal crimi-\nnal prosecution is more limiting to a President than the bur-\nden of exposure to civil suits does not make it true, and it is\nnot persuasive.\n   Second, federal criminal prosecutions require \u201crobust pro-\ncedural safeguards\u201d not found in civil suits. 704 F. Supp. 3d,\nat 214. The criminal justice system has layers of protec-\ntions that \u201cflter out insubstantial legal claims,\u201d whereas civil\nlitigation lacks \u201canalogous checks.\u201d Cheney v. United States\nDist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 386 (2004). To start,\nJustice Department policy requires scrupulous and impartial\nprosecution, founded on both the facts and the law. See gen-\nerally Dept. of Justice, Justice Manual \u00a7 9\u201327.000 (Principles\nof Federal Prosecution) (June 2023). The grand jury pro-\nvides an additional check on felony prosecutions, acting as a\n\u201cbuffer or referee between the Government and the people,\u201d\nto ensure that the charges are well founded. United States\nv. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 47 (1992); see also Harlow v. Fitz-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ngerald, 457 U. S. 800, 826, n. 6 (1982) (Burger, C. J., dissent-\ning) (\u201c[A] criminal prosecution cannot be commenced absent\ncareful consideration by a grand jury at the request of a\nprosecutor; the same check is not present with respect to the\ncommencement of civil suits in which advocates are subject\nto no realistic accountability\u201d).\n   If the prosecution makes it past the grand jury, then the\nformer President still has all the protections our system pro-\nvides to criminal defendants. If the former President has\nan argument that a particular statute is unconstitutional as\napplied to him, then he can move to dismiss the charges on\nthat ground. Indeed, a former President is likely to have\nlegal arguments that would be unavailable to the average\ncriminal defendant. For example, he may be able to rely on\na public-authority exception from particular criminal laws,3\n  3\n   See Nardone v. United States, 302 U. S. 379, 384 (1937) (explaining\nthat public offcers may be \u201cimpliedly excluded from [statutory] language\nembracing all persons\u201d if reading the statute to include such offcers\n\f672                   TRUMP v.

See United States v.\nGaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510 (1995). If the Government man-\nages to overcome even that signifcant hurdle, then the for-\nmer President can appeal his conviction, and the appellate\nreview of his claims will be \u201c `particularly meticulous.' \u201d\nTrump v. Vance, 591 U. S. 786, 809 (2020) (quoting Nixon,\n418 U. S., at 702). He can ultimately seek this Court's re-\nview, and if past practice (including in this case) is any indi-\ncation, he will receive it.\n  In light of these considerable protections, the majority's\nfear that \u201c `bare allegations of malice,' \u201d ante, at 619 (alter-\nation omitted), would expose former Presidents to trial and\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nconviction is unfounded. Bare allegations of malice would\nnot make it out of the starting gate. Although a private\ncivil action may be brought based on little more than \u201c `in-\ntense feelings,' \u201d ante, at 611 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.,\nat 752), a federal criminal prosecution is made of frmer stuff.\nCertainly there has been, on occasion, great feelings of ani-\n\n\u201cwould work obvious absurdity as, for example, the application of a speed\nlaw to a policeman pursuing a criminal or the driver of a fre engine re-\nsponding to an alarm\u201d); see also Memorandum from D.

Yet those defenses would have protected former Presidents\nfrom unwarranted criminal prosecutions much more precisely than the\nblanket immunity the majority creates today.\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

Yet it took allegations as\ngrave as those at the center of this case to have the frst\nfederal criminal prosecution of a former President. That re-\nstraint is telling.\n   Third, because of longstanding interpretations by the Ex-\necutive Branch, every sitting President has so far believed\nhimself under the threat of criminal liability after his term\nin offce and nevertheless boldly fulflled the duties of his\noffce. The majority insists that the threat of criminal sanc-\ntions is \u201cmore likely to distort Presidential decisionmaking\nthan the potential payment of civil damages.\u201d Ante, at 613.\nIf that is right, then that distortion has been shaping Presi-\ndential decisionmaking since the earliest days of the Repub-\nlic. Although it makes sense to avoid \u201cdiversion of the Pres-\nident's attention during the decisionmaking process\u201d with\n\u201cneedless worry,\u201d Clinton, 520 U. S., at 694, n. 19, one won-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nders why requiring some small amount of his attention (or\nhis legal advisers' attention) to go towards complying with\nfederal criminal law is such a great burden.

II,\n\u00a7 3, he has not been rendered \u201c `unduly cautious,' \u201d ante, at\n611 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 32). Some\namount of caution is necessary, after all. It is a far greater\ndanger if the President feels empowered to violate federal\ncriminal law, buoyed by the knowledge of future immunity.\nI am deeply troubled by the idea, inherent in the majority's\nopinion, that our Nation loses something valuable when the\nPresident is forced to operate within the confnes of federal\ncriminal law.\n   So what exactly is the majority worried about deterring\nwhen it expresses great concern for the \u201cdeterrent\u201d effect\nthat \u201cthe threat of trial, judgment, and imprisonment\u201d would\npose? Ante, at 613. It cannot possibly be the deterrence of\nacts that are truly criminal. Nor does it make sense for the\nmajority to wring its hands over the possibility that Presi-\n\f674               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\ndents might stop and think carefully before taking action\nthat borders on criminal. Instead, the majority's main con-\ncern could be that Presidents will be deterred from taking\nnecessary and lawful action by the fear that their successors\nmight pin them with a baseless criminal prosecution\u2014a\nprosecution that would almost certainly be doomed to fail, if\nit even made it out of the starting gate. See ante, at 640.\nThe Court should not have so little faith in this Nation's\nPresidents. As this Court has said before in the context of\ncriminal proceedings, \u201c `[t]he chance that now and then there\nmay be found some timid soul who will take counsel of his\nfears and give way to their repressive power is too remote\nand shadowy to shape the course of justice.' \u201d Nixon, 418\nU. S., at 712, n. 20 (quoting Clark v. United States, 289 U. S.\n1, 16 (1933)). The concern that countless (and baseless) civil\nsuits would hamper the Executive may have been justifed\nin Fitzgerald, but a well-founded federal criminal prosecu-\ntion poses no comparable danger to the functioning of the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nExecutive Branch.\n                                2\n   At the same time, the public interest in a federal criminal\nprosecution of a former President is vastly greater than the\npublic interest in a private individual's civil suit. All nine\nJustices in Fitzgerald explicitly recognized that distinction.\nThe fve-Justice majority noted that there was a greater pub-\nlic interest \u201cin criminal prosecutions\u201d than in \u201cactions for\ncivil damages.\u201d 457 U.

The four dissent-\ning Justices agreed that a \u201ccontention that the President is\nimmune from criminal prosecution in the courts,\u201d if ever\nmade, would not \u201cbe credible.\u201d Id., at 780 (White, J., dis-\nsenting). At the very least, the Fitzgerald Court did not\nexpect that its balancing test would lead to the same out-\ncome in the criminal context.\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

It is in those cases\nwhere the public can see that offcials exercising power\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nunder public trust remain on equal footing with their fellow\ncitizens under the criminal law. See, e. g., O'Shea v. Little-\nton, 414 U. S. 488, 503 (1974) (\u201c[W]e have never held that the\nperformance of the duties of judicial, legislative, or executive\noffcers, requires or contemplates the immunization of other-\nwise criminal deprivations of constitutional rights\u201d); Dennis\nv.

Even judges, cloaked\nwith absolute civil immunity for centuries, could be pun-\nished criminally\u201d).\n\f676               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\n   The public interest in the federal criminal prosecution of\na former President alleged to have used the powers of his\noffce to commit crimes may be greater still. \u201c[T]he Presi-\ndent . . . represent[s] all the voters in the Nation,\u201d and his\npowers are given by the people under our Constitution.\nAnderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 795 (1983). When\nPresidents use the powers of their offce for personal gain or\nas part of a criminal scheme, every person in the country\nhas an interest in that criminal prosecution. The majority\noverlooks that paramount interest entirely.\n   Finally, the question of federal criminal immunity for a\nformer President \u201cinvolves a countervailing Article II con-\nsideration absent in Fitzgerald\u201d: recognizing such an immu-\nnity \u201cwould frustrate the Executive Branch's enforcement of\nthe criminal law.\u201d Brief for United States 19. The Presi-\ndent is, of course, entrusted with \u201c `supervisory and policy\nresponsibilities of utmost discretion and sensitivity.' \u201d Ante,\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nat 610\u2013611 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 750). One of\nthe most important is \u201cenforcement of federal law,\u201d as \u201cit is\nthe President who is charged constitutionally to `take Care\nthat the Laws be faithfully executed.' \u201d Id., at 750 (quoting\nArt. II, \u00a7 3). The majority seems to think that allowing for-\nmer Presidents to escape accountability for breaking the law\nwhile disabling the current Executive from prosecuting such\nviolations somehow respects the independence of the Execu-\ntive. It does not. Rather, it diminishes that independence,\nexalting occupants of the offce over the offce itself. There\nis a twisted irony in saying, as the majority does, that the\nperson charged with \u201ctak[ing] Care that the Laws be faith-\nfully executed\u201d can break them with impunity.\n   In the case before us, the public interest and countervail-\ning Article II interest are particularly stark. The public in-\nterest in this criminal prosecution implicates both \u201c[t]he Ex-\necutive Branch's interest in upholding Presidential elections\nand vesting power in a new President under the Constitu-\ntion\u201d as well as \u201cthe voters' interest in democratically select-\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

It also, of course, implicates Congress's own\ninterest in regulating conduct through the criminal law. Cf.\nFitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 749, n. 27 (noting that the case did\nnot involve \u201caffrmative action by Congress\u201d). Yet the ma-\njority believes that a President's anxiety over prosecution\noverrides the public's interest in accountability and negates\nthe interests of the other branches in carrying out their con-\nstitutionally assigned functions. It is, in fact, the majority's\nposition that \u201cboil[s] down to ignoring the Constitution's sep-\naration of powers.\u201d Ante, at 640.\n\n                                C\n   Finally, in an attempt to put some distance between its\noffcial-acts immunity and Trump's requested immunity, the\nmajority insists that \u201cTrump asserts a far broader immunity\nthan the limited one [the majority has] recognized.\u201d Ante,\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nat 632. If anything, the opposite is true. The only part of\nTrump's immunity argument that the majority rejects is the\nidea that \u201cthe Impeachment Judgment Clause requires that\nimpeachment and Senate conviction precede a President's\ncriminal prosecution.\u201d Ibid. That argument is obviously\nwrong. See ante, at 632\u2013634. Rejecting it, however, does\nnot make the majority's immunity narrower than Trump's.\nInherent in Trump's Impeachment Judgment Clause argu-\nment is the idea that a former President who was impeached\nin the House and convicted in the Senate for crimes involving\nhis offcial acts could then be prosecuted in court for those\nacts. See Brief for Petitioner 22 (\u201cThe Founders thus\nadopted a carefully balanced approach that permits the crim-\ninal prosecution of a former President for his offcial acts,\nbut only if that President is frst impeached by the House\nand convicted by the Senate\u201d). By extinguishing that path\nto overcoming immunity, however nonsensical it might be,\nthe majority arrives at an offcial-acts immunity even more\nexpansive than the one Trump argued for. On the majori-\n\f678                TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nty's view (but not Trump's), a former President whose abuse\nof power was so egregious and so offensive even to members\nof his own party that he was impeached in the House and\nconvicted in the Senate still would be entitled to \u201cat least\npresumptive\u201d criminal immunity for those acts.\n\n                                V\n   Separate from its offcial-acts immunity, the majority rec-\nognizes absolute immunity for \u201cconduct within [the Presi-\ndent's] exclusive sphere of constitutional authority.\u201d Ante,\nat 609. Feel free to skip over those pages of the majority's\nopinion. With broad offcial-acts immunity covering the\nfeld, this ostensibly narrower immunity serves little pur-\npose. In any event, this case simply does not turn on con-\nduct within the President's \u201cexclusive sphere of constitu-\ntional authority,\u201d and the majority's attempt to apply a core\nimmunity of its own making expands the concept of \u201ccore\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nconstitutional powers,\u201d ante, at 606, beyond any recogniz-\nable bounds.\n   The idea of a narrow core immunity might have some intu-\nitive appeal, in a case that actually presented the issue. If\nthe President's power is \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d on a\ngiven subject, then Congress should not be able to \u201cac[t]\nupon the subject.\u201d Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Saw-\nyer, 343 U. S. 579, 638 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). In\nhis Youngstown concurrence, Justice Robert Jackson posited\nthat the President's \u201cpower of removal in executive agen-\ncies\u201d seemed to fall within this narrow category. Ibid., n. 4.\nOther decisions of this Court indicate that the pardon power\nalso falls in this category, see United States v. Klein, 13 Wall.\n128, 147 (1872) (\u201cTo the executive alone is intrusted the\npower of pardon; and it is granted without limit\u201d), as does\nthe power to recognize foreign countries, see Zivotofsky v.\nKerry, 576 U. S. 1, 32 (2015) (holding that the President has\n\u201cexclusive power . . . to control recognition determinations\u201d).\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)           679\n\n                    Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\n   In this case, however, the question whether a former Pres-\nident enjoys a narrow immunity for the \u201cexercise of his core\nconstitutional powers,\u201d ante, at 606, has never been at issue,\nand for good reason: Trump was not criminally indicted for\ntaking actions that the Constitution places in the unassail-\nable core of Executive power. He was not charged, for ex-\nample, with illegally wielding the Presidency's pardon power\nor veto power or appointment power or even removal power.\nInstead, Trump was charged with a conspiracy to commit\nfraud to subvert the Presidential election. It is true that\nthe detailed indictment in this case alleges that Trump\nthreatened to remove an Acting Attorney General who\nwould not carry out his scheme. See, e. g., App. 216\u2013217,\nIndictment \u00b6\u00b674, 77. Yet it is equally clear that the Govern-\nment does not seek to \u201cimpose criminal liability on the\n[P]resident for exercising or talking about exercising the ap-\npointment and removal power.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 127. If\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthat were the majority's concern, it could simply have said\nthat the Government cannot charge a President's threatened\nuse of the removal power as an overt act in the conspiracy.\nIt says much more.\n   The core immunity that the majority creates will insulate\na considerably larger sphere of conduct than the narrow core\nof \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d powers that the Court pre-\nviously has recognized. The frst indication comes when the\nmajority includes the President's broad duty to \u201c `take Care\nthat the Laws be faithfully executed' \u201d among the core func-\ntions for which a former President supposedly enjoys abso-\nlute immunity. Ante, at 620 (quoting Art. II, \u00a7 3). That ex-\npansive view of core power will effectively insulate all sorts\nof noncore conduct from criminal prosecution. Were there\nany question, consider how the majority applies its newly\nminted core immunity to the allegations in this case. It con-\ncludes that \u201cTrump is . . . absolutely immune from prosecu-\ntion for\u201d any \u201cconduct involving his discussions with Justice\n\f680               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nDepartment offcials.\u201d Ante, at 621. That conception of\ncore immunity expands the \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d cate-\ngory beyond recognition, foreclosing the possibility of prose-\ncution for broad swaths of conduct. Under that view of core\npowers, even fabricating evidence and insisting the Depart-\nment use it in a criminal case could be covered. The majori-\nty's conception of \u201ccore\u201d immunity sweeps far more broadly\nthan its logic, borrowed from Youngstown, should allow.\n   The majority tries to assuage any concerns about its made-\nup core immunity by suggesting that the Government agrees\nwith it. See ante, at 634. That suggestion will surprise the\nGovernment. To say, as the Government did, that a \u201csmall\ncore of exclusive offcial acts\u201d such as \u201cthe pardon power,\nthe power to recognize foreign nations, the power to veto\nlegislation, [and] the power to make appointments\u201d cannot\nbe regulated by Congress, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 85\u201387, does\nnot suggest that the Government agrees with immunizing\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nany and all conduct conceivably related to the majority's\nbroad array of supposedly \u201ccore\u201d powers. The Government\nin fact advised this Court to \u201cleav[e] potentially more diff-\ncult questions\u201d about the scope of any immunity \u201cthat might\narise on different facts for decision if they are ever pre-\nsented.\u201d Brief for United States 45. That would have\nmade sense. The indictment here does not pose any threat\nof impermissibly criminalizing acts within the President's\n\u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d authority. Perhaps for this rea-\nson, even Trump discouraged consideration of \u201ca narrower\nscope of immunity,\u201d claiming that such an immunity \u201cwould\nbe nearly impossible to fashion, and would certainly involve\nimpractical line-drawing problems in every application.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 43\u201344.\n   When forced to wade into thorny separation-of-powers dis-\nputes, this Court's usual practice is to \u201cconfne the opinion\nonly to the very questions necessary to decision of the case.\u201d\nDames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 661 (1981). There\nis plenty of peril and little value in crafting a core immunity\n\f                       Cite as: 603 U.

It says that acts for which the\nPresident is immune must be redacted from the narrative of\neven wholly private crimes committed while in offce. They\nmust play no role in proceedings regarding private criminal\nacts. See ante, at 630\u2013632.\n   Even though the majority's immunity analysis purports to\nleave unoffcial acts open to prosecution, its draconian ap-\nproach to offcial-acts evidence deprives these prosecutions\nof any teeth. If the former President cannot be held crimi-\nnally liable for his offcial acts, those acts should still be ad-\nmissible to prove knowledge or intent in criminal prosecu-\ntions of unoffcial acts. For instance, the majority struggles\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nwith classifying whether a President's speech is in his capac-\nity as President (offcial act) or as a candidate (unoffcial act).\nImagine a President states in an offcial speech that he in-\ntends to stop a political rival from passing legislation that he\nopposes, no matter what it takes to do so (offcial act). He\nthen hires a private hitman to murder that political rival\n(unoffcial act). Under the majority's rule, the murder in-\ndictment could include no allegation of the President's public\nadmission of premeditated intent to support the mens rea of\nmurder. That is a strange result, to say the least.5\n   The majority's extraordinary rule has no basis in law.\nConsider the First Amendment context. Although the First\nAmendment prohibits criminalizing most speech, it \u201cdoes not\n  5\n    The majority suggests, in a footnote, that a \u201cprosecutor may point to\nthe public record to show the fact that the President performed the offcial\nact,\u201d so long as the prosecutor does not \u201cinvite the jury to inspect\u201d the\nact in any way. Ante, at 632, n. 3. Whatever that suggestion is supposed\nto accomplish, it does not salvage the majority's nonsensical evidentiary\nrule.\n\f682                  TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nprohibit the evidentiary use of speech,\u201d including its use \u201cto\nprove motive or intent.\u201d Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S.\n476, 489 (1993). Evidentiary rulings and limiting instruc-\ntions can ensure that evidence concerning offcial acts is\n\u201cconsidered only for the proper purpose for which it was ad-\nmitted.\u201d Huddleston v. United States, 485 U. S. 681, 691\u2013\n692 (1988). The majority has no coherent explanation as to\nwhy these protections that are suffcient in every other con-\ntext would be insuffcient here. It simply asserts that it\nwould be \u201cuntenable\u201d and would deprive immunity of its\n\u201c `intended effect.' \u201d Ante, at 631 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457\nU. S., at 756). The majority hazards an explanation that the\nuse of offcial-acts evidence will \u201craise a unique risk that the\njurors' deliberations will be prejudiced by their views of the\nPresident's policies and performance while in offce.\u201d Ante,\nat 631. That \u201cunique risk,\u201d however, is not a product of in-\ntroducing offcial-acts evidence. It is simply the risk in-\nvolved in any suit against a former President, including the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nprivate-acts prosecutions the majority says it would allow.\n\n                                  VII\n  Today's decision to grant former Presidents immunity for\ntheir offcial acts is deeply wrong. As troubling as this\ncriminal immunity doctrine is in theory, the majority's appli-\ncation of the doctrine to the indictment in this case is per-\nhaps even more troubling. In the hands of the majority, this\nnew offcial-acts immunity operates as a one-way ratchet.\n  First, the majority declares all of the conduct involving\nthe Justice Department and the Vice President to be offcial\nconduct, see ante, at 619\u2013625, yet it refuses to designate any\ncourse of conduct alleged in the indictment as private, de-\nspite concessions from Trump's counsel.6 Trump's counsel\n  6\n    The majority protests that it is \u201cadher[ing] to time-tested practices\u201d\nby \u201cdeciding what is required to dispose of this case and remanding\u201d to\nlower courts to sort out the details. Ante, at 641. Yet it implicitly ac-\nknowledges that it reaches far beyond what any lower court considered or\n\f                       Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)                    683\n\n                        Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nconceded, for example, that the allegation that Trump\n\u201cturned to a private attorney who was willing to spread\nknowingly false claims of election fraud to spearhead his\nchallenges to the election results\u201d \u201csounds private.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 29. He likewise conceded that the allegation that\nTrump \u201cconspired with another private attorney who caused\nthe fling in court of a verifcation signed by [Trump] that\ncontained false allegations to support a challenge\u201d \u201csounds\nprivate.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at 36\u201337 (Trump's counsel ex-\nplaining that it is not \u201cdisputed\u201d that such conduct is \u201cunof-\nfcial\u201d). Again, when asked about allegations that \u201c[t]hree\nprivate actors . . . helped implement a plan to submit fraudu-\nlent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certifca-\ntion proceeding, and [Trump] and a co-conspirator attorney\ndirected that effort,\u201d Trump's counsel conceded the alleged\nconduct was \u201cprivate.\u201d Id., at 29\u201330. Only the majority\nthinks that organizing fraudulent slates of electors might\nqualify as an offcial act of the President, see ante, at 625\u2013\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n628, or at least an act so \u201cinterrelated\u201d with other allegedly\noffcial acts that it might warrant protection, ante, at 628.\nIf the majority's sweeping conception of \u201coffcial acts\u201d has\nany real limits, the majority is unwilling to reveal them in\ntoday's decision.\n   Second, the majority designates certain conduct immune\nwhile refusing to recognize anything as prosecutable. It\nshields large swaths of conduct involving the Justice Depart-\nment with immunity, see ante, at 619\u2013621; see also Part V,\nsupra, but it does not give an inch in the other direction.\nThe majority admits that the Vice President's responsibility\n\u201c `presiding over the Senate' \u201d is \u201c `not an \u201cexecutive branch\u201d\n\nany party briefed by designating certain conduct offcial in the frst in-\nstance. See ibid. (noting \u201cthe lack of factual analysis in the lower courts,\nand the lack of briefng on how to categorize the conduct alleged\u201d). In\nreaching out to shield some conduct as offcial while refusing to recognize\nany conduct as unoffcial, the majority engages in judicial activism, not\njudicial restraint.\n\f684               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nfunction,' \u201d and it further admits that the President \u201cplays\nno direct constitutional or statutory role\u201d in the counting of\nelectoral votes. Ante, at 624. Yet the majority refuses to\nconclude that Trump lacks immunity for his alleged attempts\nto \u201cenlist the Vice President to use his ceremonial role at the\nJanuary 6 certifcation proceeding to fraudulently alter the\nelection results.\u201d App. 187, Indictment \u00b610(d). Instead, it\nworries that a prosecution for this conduct might make it\nharder for the President to use the Vice President \u201cto ad-\nvance [his] agenda in Congress.\u201d Ante, at 624. Such a\nprosecution, according to the majority, \u201cmay well hinder the\nPresident's ability to perform his constitutional functions.\u201d\nIbid. Whether a prosecution for this conduct warrants im-\nmunity should have been an easy question, but the majority\nturns it into a debatable one. Remarkably, the majority\ngoes further and declines to deny immunity even for the alle-\ngations that Trump organized fraudulent elector slates, pres-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nsured States to subvert the legitimate election results,\nand exploited violence at the Capitol to infuence the certif-\ncation proceedings. It is not conceivable that a prosecu-\ntion for these alleged efforts to overturn a Presidential elec-\ntion, whether labeled offcial or unoffcial under the majori-\nty's test, would pose any \u201c `dangers of intrusion on the\nauthority and functions of the Executive Branch,' \u201d ante, at\n615, and the majority could have said as much. Instead,\nit perseverates on a threshold question that should be\nimmaterial.\n   Looking beyond the fate of this particular prosecution, the\nlong-term consequences of today's decision are stark. The\nCourt effectively creates a law-free zone around the Presi-\ndent, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the\nfounding. This new offcial-acts immunity now \u201clies about\nlike a loaded weapon\u201d for any President that wishes to place\nhis own interests, his own political survival, or his own f-\nnancial gain, above the interests of the Nation.

Put simply, immunity\nis \u201cexemption\u201d from the duties and liabilities imposed by law.\nBlack's Law Dictionary 898 (11th ed. 2019); see Hopkins v.\nClemson, 221 U. S. 636, 643 (1911) (explaining that immunity\nis \u201cexemption from legal process\u201d). In its purest form, the\nconcept of immunity boils down to a maxim\u2014\u201c `[t]he King\ncan do no wrong' \u201d\u2014a notion that was frmly \u201crejected at the\nbirth of [our] Republic.\u201d Clinton v.

To say that someone is im-\nmune from criminal prosecution is to say that, like a King,\nhe \u201cis not under the coercive power of the law,\u201d which \u201cwill\nnot suppose him capable of committing a folly, much less a\ncrime.\u201d 4 Blackstone *33. Thus, being immune is not like\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)            687\n\n                     Jackson, J., dissenting\n\nhaving a defense under the law. Rather, it means that the\nlaw does not apply to the immunized person in the frst place.\nConferring immunity therefore \u201ccreate[s] a privileged class\nfree from liability for wrongs inficted or injuries threat-\nened.\u201d Hopkins, 221 U. S., at 643.\n   It is indisputable that immunity from liability for wrongdo-\ning is the exception rather than the rule in the American\ncriminal justice system. That is entirely unsurprising, for\nthe very idea of immunity stands in tension with founda-\ntional principles of our system of Government. It is a core\ntenet of our democracy that the People are the sovereign,\nand the Rule of Law is our frst and fnal security. \u201c[F]rom\ntheir own experience and their deep reading in history, the\nFounders knew that Law alone saves a society from being\nrent by internecine strife or ruled by mere brute power how-\never disguised.\u201d United States v.

Criminal law starts with\nan act of the legislature, which holds the power \u201cto defne a\ncrime, and ordain its punishment.\u201d United States v. Wilt-\nberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820); accord, Ohio v. Johnson, 467\nU. S. 493, 499 (1984). Criminal statutes are laws of general\napplicability that express \u201cthe assent of the people's repre-\nsentatives\u201d that certain conduct is off limits in our society.\nWooden v. United States, 595 U. S. 360, 391 (2022) (Gor-\nsuch, J., concurring in judgment).\n   When the Federal Government believes that someone has\nrun afoul of a criminal statute and decides to exercise its\nprosecutorial discretion to pursue punishment for that viola-\ntion, it persuades a grand jury that there is probable cause\nto indict. U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. Then, the Government\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nmarshals evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe defendant engaged in the prohibited conduct and pos-\nsessed the requisite state of mind. See United States v.\nBailey, 444 U. S. 394, 402 (1980) (observing that, to hold a\nperson criminally liable, \u201cthe concurrence of . . . `an evil-\nmeaning mind [and] an evil-doing hand' \u201d must be proved\n(quoting Morissette v.

And even before trial, in a motion to dismiss\nthe indictment, he might make any number of legal argu-\nments; he can assert, for example, that the Government's\ncharging document does not give adequate notice of the\ncharge against him or that the law he has been accused of\nviolating is unconstitutionally vague. See Hamling v.\nUnited States, 418 U. S. 87, 117 (1974); United States v.\nDavis, 588 U. S. 445, 451 (2019). He might further claim\nthat the law is unconstitutional as applied to his particular\nconduct. See United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376\n(1968). And he might maintain that his conduct, even if\nproved, does not violate the law at issue. See, e. g., Fischer\nv. United States, 603 U. S. 480, 484\u2013485 (2024).\n   The defendant may also raise, and attempt to prove, af-\nfrmative defenses that \u201cexcuse conduct that would other-\nwise be punishable.\u201d Dixon v. United States, 548 U. S. 1, 6\n(2006). Generally speaking, affrmative defenses are deter-\nminations (often adopted by legislation) that certain conduct\nPage Proof Pending Publication\notherwise punishable by law is justifed. This might be the\ncase, for example, when the Legislature determines that,\nunder specifed circumstances, the societal harm particular\nconduct causes \u201cis outweighed by the need to avoid an even\ngreater harm.\u201d 1 P. Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses\n\u00a7 24(a) (1984) (Robinson).\n   Importantly, a defense is not an immunity, even though a\ndefense can likewise result in a person charged with a crime\navoiding liability for his criminal conduct. Consistent with\nour foundational norms, the individual accountability model\nadheres to the presumption that the law applies to all and\nthat everyone must follow it; yet, the model makes allow-\nances for recognized defenses. One such defense is the spe-\ncial privilege that Government offcials sometimes invoke\nwhen carrying out their offcial duties.1\n  1\n   See R. Perkins & R. Boyce, Criminal Law 1093 (3d ed. 1982) (\u201cDeeds\nwhich otherwise would be criminal, such as taking or destroying property,\ntaking hold of a person by force and against his will, placing him in con-\n\f690                   TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Jackson, J., dissenting\n\n   All of this is to say that our Government has long func-\ntioned under an accountability paradigm in which no one is\nabove the law; an accused person is innocent until proven\nguilty; and criminal defendants may raise defenses, both\nlegal and factual, tailored to their particular circumstances,\nwhether they be Government offcials or ordinary citizens.\nFor over two centuries, our Nation has survived with these\nprinciples intact.\n                               B\n   With that understanding of how our system of accountabil-\nity for criminal acts ordinarily functions, it becomes much\neasier to see that the majority's ruling in this case breaks\nnew and dangerous ground. Departing from the traditional\nmodel of individual accountability, the majority has con-\ncocted something entirely different: a Presidential account-\nability model that creates immunity\u2014an exemption from\ncriminal law\u2014applicable only to the most powerful offcial in\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nour Government.\n                               1\n   So, how does this new Presidential accountability model\nwork? An initial problem is the lack of clarity regarding\nwhat this new model entails. The majority announces only\nits most basic contours. See ante, at 606 (asserting that \u201cthe\nnature of Presidential power requires that a former President\nhave some immunity from criminal prosecution for offcial\nacts during his tenure in offce\u201d). Instead of no immunity\n(the individual accountability model) or an unqualifed grant\nof absolute immunity for \u201call offcial acts,\u201d Brief for Peti-\ntioner 44 (emphasis added), the majority purports to adopt\n\nfnement, or even taking his life, are not crimes if done with proper public\nauthority\u201d); see also 2 Robinson \u00a7 141(a) (describing the public-authority\ndefense, under which a defendant may escape liability if he \u201chas been\nspecifcally authorized to engage in the conduct constituting the offense in\norder to protect or further a public interest\u201d); Brief for United States 29\u2013\n30, and n. 11; ante, at 671, n. 3 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (citing Nardone\nv.

S. 593 (2024)                     691\n\n                          Jackson, J., dissenting\n\nsomething of a hybrid.2 It holds that a former President\nmay or may not be immune from criminal prosecution for\nconduct undertaken while in offce, to be determined on a\ncase-by-case basis. According to the majority, whether a\nformer President is immune depends on how his criminal\nconduct is classifed, as among three possible categories.\n   First, with respect to any criminal conduct relating to a\nPresident's \u201ccore constitutional powers\u201d\u2014those subjects\n\u201cwithin his `conclusive and preclusive' constitutional author-\nity\u201d\u2014the President is entitled to absolute immunity from\ncriminal prosecution. See ante, at 606, 609. Second, ex-\npanding outward from this \u201ccore,\u201d regarding all other \u201cacts\nwithin the outer perimeter of [the President's] offcial re-\nsponsibility,\u201d the President is entitled to \u201cat least a presump-\ntive immunity from criminal prosecution.\u201d Ante, at 614.\nThird, if the criminal conduct at issue comprises \u201cunoffcial\nacts, there is no immunity.\u201d Ante, at 615.3\n\nPage\n  2\n    Its feignedProof         Pending\n                judicial humility notwithstanding, Publication\n                                                   see ante, at 641, the ma-\njority's holding goes further\u2014much further\u2014than necessary to resolve\nthis case. Petitioner's argument in both the lower courts and this one\nwas that a former President is categorically immune from federal criminal\nprosecution for \u201call\u201d acts within the outer perimeter of his offcial duties.\nSee Opening Brief for Defendant-Appellant in No. 23\u20133228 (CADC, Dec.\n23, 2023), p. 9; 91 F. 4th 1173, 1188\u20131189, 1195, 1208 (CADC 2024) (per cu-\nriam); Brief for Petitioner 41\u201347 (arguing for absolute immunity for \u201call\nactions within the `outer perimeter' \u201d of a President's responsibilities, and\nimploring the Court not to adopt a \u201c `function-based' approach\u201d). Thus, it\nwould have been enough for the Court simply to reject petitioner's cate-\ngorical claim and leave it at that. But the majority sua sponte rephrased\nthe question presented, and it now takes full advantage of this opportunity\nto devise from whole cloth an entirely new legal framework for judicial\nevaluation of potential criminal immunity for former Presidents.\n   3\n     It is important to note that the majority reframes the immunity question\npresented here as a separation of powers concern that is compelled by Arti-\ncle II\u2014as if what is being asked is whether Congress can criminalize execu-\ntive prerogatives. See, e. g., ante, at 606\u2013607; see also ante, at 650\u2013652\n(Barrett, J., concurring in part). But that is not anywhere close to what\nis happening in this case. No one maintains that Congress has passed a\nlaw that specifcally criminalizes the President's use of any power that the\n\f692                  TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Jackson, J., dissenting\n\n   Applying the majority's new Presidential accountability\nmodel thus seems to involve bearing down on the indict-\nment's allegations and making a series of determinations\nabout the nature of the conduct at issue. From the struc-\nture of the paradigm, it appears that the frst decision point\nis whether the alleged criminal conduct involves one of the\nPresident's \u201ccore\u201d powers. If so (and apparently regardless\nof the degree to which the conduct implicates that core\npower), the President is absolutely immune from criminal\nliability for engaging in that criminal conduct. If not, then\none must proceed to consider whether the conduct qualifes\nas an \u201coffcial\u201d act or \u201cunoffcial\u201d act of that President. If\nthe crime is an offcial act, the President is presumptively\nimmune from criminal prosecution and punishment. But\neven then, immunity still hinges on whether there is any\nlegal or factual basis for concluding that the presumption of\nimmunity has been rebutted. Alternatively, if the charged\nconduct is an unoffcial act (a determination that, inciden-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ntally, courts must make without considering the President's\nmotivations, ante, at 618), the President is not immune.4\n\nConstitution vests exclusively in the Executive, much less that the Judi-\nciary is being conscripted to adjudicate the propriety of such a statute.\nTo the contrary, the indictment here invokes criminal statutes of general\napplicability that everyone is supposed to follow, both on and off the job.\nSo, the real question is: Can the President, too, be held accountable for\ncommitting crimes while he is undertaking his offcial duties? The nature\nof his authority under Article II (whether conclusive and preclusive, or\nshared with Congress, or otherwise) is entirely beside the point.\n   4\n     Justice Barrett's version of the Presidential accountability para-\ndigm works slightly differently; she would have us ask, frst, \u201cwhether\nthe relevant criminal statute reaches the President's offcial conduct.\u201d\nAnte, at 652. But, again, what is at issue here are statutes of general\napplicability\u2014they only \u201creach\u201d the President's conduct to the extent that\nhe chooses to engage in the prohibited behavior. See n. 3, supra. Jus-\ntice Barrett's framing, thus, sidesteps the fact that, when immunity is\nbeing considered, what is actually at issue is whether the President is\nexempt from punishment if he opts to exercise his offcial duties using\nmeans that violate criminal law.\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)            693\n\n                     Jackson, J., dissenting\n\n                                2\n   The majority's multilayered, multifaceted threshold pars-\ning of the character of a President's criminal conduct differs\nfrom the individual accountability model in several crucial\nrespects. For one thing, it makes it next to impossible to\nknow ex ante when and under what circumstances a Presi-\ndent will be subject to accountability for his criminal acts.\nFor every allegation, courts must run this gauntlet frst\u2014\nno matter how well documented or heinous the criminal act\nmight be.\n   Thus, even a hypothetical President who admits to having\nordered the assassinations of his political rivals or critics,\nsee, e. g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, or one who indisputably insti-\ngates an unsuccessful coup, id., at 41\u201343, has a fair shot at\ngetting immunity under the majority's new Presidential ac-\ncountability model. That is because whether a President's\nconduct will subject him to criminal liability turns on the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ncourt's evaluation of a variety of factors related to the char-\nacter of that particular act\u2014specifcally, those characteris-\ntics that imbue an act with the status of \u201coffcial\u201d or \u201cunoff-\ncial\u201d conduct (minus motive). In the end, then, under the\nmajority's new paradigm, whether the President will be ex-\nempt from legal liability for murder, assault, theft, fraud, or\nany other reprehensible and outlawed criminal act will turn\non whether he committed that act in his offcial capacity, such\nthat the answer to the immunity question will always and\ninevitably be: It depends.\n   Under the individual accountability paradigm, the account-\nability analysis is markedly less convoluted, and leads to a\nmore certain outcome. None of the same complications or\nconsequences arise, because, as I have explained, there are\nno exemptions from the criminal law for any person, but\nevery defendant can assert whatever legal arguments and\ndefenses might be applicable under governing law. Since no\none is above the law, everyone can focus on what the law\ndemands and permits, and on what the defendant did or did\n\f694                   TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Jackson, J., dissenting\n\nnot do; no one has to worry about characterizing any criminal\nconduct as offcial or unoffcial in order to assess the applica-\nbility of an immunity at the outset.\n   The majority's new Presidential accountability model is\nalso distinct insofar as it accepts as a basic starting premise\nthat generally applicable criminal laws do not apply to every-\none in our society. In the majority's view, while all other\ncitizens of the United States must do their jobs and live their\nlives within the confnes of criminal prohibitions, the Presi-\ndent cannot be made to do so; he must sometimes be exempt\nfrom the law's dictates depending on the character of his\nconduct. Indeed, the majority holds that the President, un-\nlike anyone else in our country, is comparatively free to\nengage in criminal acts in furtherance of his offcial duties.\n   That point bears emphasizing. Immunity can issue for\nPresidents under the majority's model even for unquestion-\nably and intentionally egregious criminal behavior. Re-\ngardless of the nature or the impact of the President's crimi-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nnal conduct, so long as he is committing crimes \u201cpursuant to\nthe powers invested exclusively in him by the Constitution,\u201d\nante, at 607, or as needed \u201cto carry out his constitutional\nduties without undue caution,\u201d ante, at 614, he is likely to be\ndeemed immune from prosecution.5\n   Ultimately, the majority's model simply sets the criminal\nlaw to one side when it comes to crimes allegedly committed\n\n   5\n     To fully appreciate the oddity of making the criminal immunity deter-\nmination turn on the character of the President's responsibilities, consider\nwhat the majority says is one of the President's \u201cconclusive and preclu-\nsive\u201d prerogatives: \u201c `[t]he President's power to remove . . . those who\nwield executive power on his behalf.' \u201d Ante, at 608 (quoting Seila Law\nLLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U. S. 197, 204 (2020)).\nWhile the President may have the authority to decide to remove the At-\ntorney General, for example, the question here is whether the President\nhas the option to remove the Attorney General by, say, poisoning him to\ndeath. Put another way, the issue here is not whether the President has\nexclusive removal power, but whether a generally applicable criminal law\nprohibiting murder can restrict how the President exercises that authority.\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

Before accountability can be sought or\nrendered, the Judiciary serves as a newfound special gate-\nkeeper, charged not merely with interpreting the law but\nwith policing whether it applies to the President at all.\nAlso, under the new Presidential accountability model, the\nstarting presumption is that the criminal law does not apply\nto Presidents, no matter how obviously illegal, harmful, or\nunacceptable a President's offcial behavior might be. Re-\ngardless of all that, courts must now ensure that a former\nPresident is not held accountable for any criminal conduct\nhe engages in while he is on duty, unless his conduct consists\nprimarily (and perhaps solely) of unoffcial acts.\n\n                                3\n   The structure and function of the two accountability para-\ndigms are not the only differences\u2014the models also assign\ndifferent roles to participants in the criminal justice system,\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nand they ultimately generate different relationships between\nthe Presidency and the Rule of Law.\n   Under the individual accountability model, duty-bound\nprosecutorial offcers initially exercise their discretion to de-\ncide whether to seek punishment for alleged violations of\ncriminal law (a determination that is made based on numer-\nous factors). And even if prosecutors decide to bring a\ncharge, a jury of the criminal defendant's peers ultimately\ndetermines whether that defendant (including a former Pres-\nident) will actually be held to account for having engaged\nin unlawful conduct, after the court has resolved any legal\nchallenges and has instructed the jury as to the require-\nments of the law.\n   By contrast, under the majority's new Presidential ac-\ncountability paradigm, what a prosecutor or jury does may\nnot even matter, since the courts take center stage once\ncharges are brought against a former President, marshaling\ntheir resources to conduct a complex and amorphous thresh-\nold immunity evaluation. Whether a former President will\n\f696               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Jackson, J., dissenting\n\nbe entirely exempted from the dictates of the law (such that\nthe roles of other participants in the criminal justice process\nbecome irrelevant) requires a judicial assessment, in the frst\ninstance, of his criminal conduct and the circumstances under\nwhich he acted.\n   Finally, and most importantly, recall that under the indi-\nvidual accountability model, an indicted former President\ncan raise an affrmative defense just like any other criminal\ndefendant. This means that the President remains answer-\nable to the law, insofar as he must show that he was justifed\nin committing a criminal act while in offce under the given\ncircumstances. In other words, while the President might\nindeed be privileged to commit a crime in the course of his\noffcial duties, any such privilege exists only when the People\n(acting either through their elected representatives or as\nmembers of a jury) determine that the former President's\nconduct was in fact justifed, notwithstanding the general\ncriminal prohibition.\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n   Under the majority's immunity regime, by contrast, the\nPresident can commit crimes in the course of his job even\nunder circumstances in which no one thinks he has any ex-\ncuse; the law simply does not apply to him. Unlike a de-\nfendant who invokes an affrmative defense and relies on a\nlegal determination that there was a good reason for his oth-\nerwise unlawful conduct, a former President invoking immu-\nnity relies on the premise that he can do whatever he wants,\nhowever he wants, so long as he uses his \u201c `offcial power' \u201d\nin doing so. Ante, at 620. In the former paradigm, the\nPresident remains subject to law; in the latter, he is above it.\n\n                               III\n  Justice Sotomayor has already warned of the dire conse-\nquences that are likely to follow from the majority's decision\nin this case. Ante, at 684\u2013685 (dissenting opinion). I have\nthus far endeavored merely to explain what today's ruling\namounts to on a theoretical level: the Court's abandonment\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

First, by chang-\ning the accountability paradigm in this fashion, the Court\nhas unilaterally altered the balance of power between the\nthree coordinate branches of our Government as it relates to\nthe Rule of Law, aggrandizing power in the Judiciary and\nthe Executive, to the detriment of Congress. Second, the\nmajority's new Presidential accountability model undermines\nthe constraints of the law as a deterrent for future Presi-\ndents who might otherwise abuse their power, to the detri-\nment of us all.\n                               A\n\nPage\n  ConsiderProof        Pending\n            the structural  implicationsPublication\n                                          of today's decision\nfrom the standpoint of the separation of powers. Until now,\nCongress's laws, passed by the representatives of the People,\nbound the People and their elected offcials just the same.\nLaw, we have explained, \u201cis the only supreme power in our\nsystem of government, and every man who by accepting of-\nfce participates in its functions is only the more strongly\nbound to submit to that supremacy, and to observe the limi-\ntations which it imposes upon the exercise of the authority\nwhich it gives.\u201d Lee, 106 U. S., at 220. With its adoption\nof a paradigm that sometimes exempts the President from\nthe dictates of the law (when the Court says so), this Court\nhas effectively snatched from the Legislature the authority\nto bind the President (or not) to Congress's mandates, and it\nhas also thereby substantially augmented the power of both\nthe Offce of the Presidency and itself.\n  As to the former, it should go without saying that the Of-\nfce of the Presidency, the apex of the Executive Branch, is\nmade signifcantly more powerful when the constraints of the\n\f698                  TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Jackson, J., dissenting\n\ncriminal law are lifted with respect to the exercise of a Presi-\ndent's offcial duties. After today's ruling, the President\nmust still \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\u201d\nArt. II, \u00a7 3; yet, when acting in his offcial capacity, he has\nno obligation to follow those same laws himself.\n   But whatever additional power the majority's new Presi-\ndential accountability model gives to the Presidency, it gives\ndoubly to the Court itself, for the majority provides no mean-\ningful guidance about how to apply this new paradigm or\nhow to categorize a President's conduct. For instance, its\nopinion lists some examples of the \u201ccore\u201d constitutional pow-\ners with respect to which the President is now entitled to\nabsolute immunity\u2014a list that apparently includes the re-\nmoval power, the power to recognize foreign nations, and the\npardon power. Ante, at 607\u2013609. However, the majority\ndoes not\u2014and likely cannot\u2014supply any useful or adminis-\ntrable defnition of the scope of that \u201ccore.\u201d For what it's\nworth, the Constitution's text is no help either; Article II\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ndoes not contain a Core Powers Clause.6 So the actual\nmetes and bounds of the \u201ccore\u201d Presidential powers are\nreally anyone's guess.\n   Nor does the majority explain how to consistently distin-\nguish between offcial and unoffcial acts. Quite the oppo-\nsite, in fact. While acknowledging that this is a critical line\nthat courts must draw in order for its new accountability\nmodel to work properly, the majority simultaneously cau-\ntions that making this distinction \u201ccan be diffcult\u201d\u2014likely a\ngross understatement given the recognized \u201cbreadth of the\n  6\n    Some of the powers the majority designates as \u201ccore\u201d powers are, at\nbest, implied from indefnite constitutional language. See, e. g., Seila\nLaw, 591 U. S., at 268\u2013269 (Kagan, J., concurring in judgment with respect\nto severability and dissenting in part) (\u201cNowhere does the text say any-\nthing about the President's power to remove subordinate offcials at will\u201d);\nZivotofsky v.

The\nmajority likewise provides no guidance as to when, how, or\nwhy the President's \u201cpresumptive\u201d immunity for noncore of-\nfcial acts might be rebutted, saying only that applying the\ncriminal law to a President's acts must pose \u201cno `dangers of\nintrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive\nBranch.' \u201d Ante, at 615 (quoting Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457\nU. S. 731, 754 (1982)).\n  At most, to distinguish offcial from unoffcial conduct, the\nmajority advises asking whether the former President's con-\nduct was \u201c `manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.' \u201d\nAnte, at 618 (quoting Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F. 4th 1, 13\n(CADC 2023)). But that test can be illusory, as is evidenced\nby the facts alleged in this very case. With respect to the\nindictment's allegations concerning petitioner's attempt to\nassemble false slates of electors in conjunction with the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nevents of January 6, 2021, for example, the majority admits\nthat the \u201calleged conduct cannot be neatly categorized,\u201d and\nthat \u201c[t]he analysis therefore . . . may prove to be challeng-\ning.\u201d Ante, at 628\u2013629. With that, at least, I could not\nagree more.\n  This much is clear: Before today, none of these kinds of\ninquiries was necessary for criminal liability to be fairly as-\nsessed with respect to persons accused of having engaged in\ncriminal conduct. And, frankly, none is needed now\u2014except\nas relates to the President under the new paradigm the ma-\njority has crafted.\n  Perhaps even more troubling, while Congress (the branch\nof our Government most accountable to the People) is the\nentity our Constitution tasks with deciding, as a general mat-\nter, what conduct is on or off limits, the Court has now arro-\ngated that power unto itself when that question pertains to\nthe President. In essence, the Court has now imposed its\nown preclearance requirement on the application of Con-\ngress's laws to a former President alleged to have committed\n\f700               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Jackson, J., dissenting\n\ncrimes while in offce. Who will be responsible for drawing\nthe crucial \u201c `line between [the President's] personal and of-\nfcial affairs' \u201d? Ante, at 629. To ask the question is to know\nthe answer. A majority of this Court, applying an indeter-\nminate test, will pick and choose which laws apply to which\nPresidents, by labeling his various allegedly criminal acts\nas \u201ccore,\u201d \u201coffcial,\u201d or \u201cmanifestly or palpably\u201d beyond the\nPresident's authority.\n   Ironically, then, while purportedly seeking to transcend\npolitics, see ante, at 641\u2013642, the Court today displaces the\nindependent judgments of the political branches about the\ncircumstances under which the criminal law should apply.\nEffectively, the Court elbows out of the way both Congress\nand prosecutorial authorities within the Executive Branch,\nmaking itself the indispensable player in all future attempts\nto hold former Presidents accountable to generally applicable\ncriminal laws. \u201cThe Framers, however, did not make the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\njudiciary the overseer of our government.\u201d Youngstown\nSheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 594 (1952) (Frank-\nfurter, J., concurring). To be sure, this Court may some-\ntimes \u201chave to intervene in determining where authority lies\nas between the democratic forces in our scheme of govern-\nment.\u201d Id., at 597. But it has long been understood that\n\u201cwe should be wary and humble\u201d when doing so. Ibid.\n   The majority displays no such caution or humility now.\nInstead, the Court today transfers from the political\nbranches to itself the power to decide when the President\ncan be held accountable. What is left in its wake is a greatly\nweakened Congress, which must stand idly by as the Presi-\ndent disregards its criminal prohibitions and uses the powers\nof his offce to push the envelope, while choosing to follow\n(or not) existing laws, as he sees ft. We also now have a\ngreatly empowered Court, which can opt to allow Congress's\npolicy judgments criminalizing conduct to stand (or not) with\nrespect to a former President, as a matter of its own\nprerogative.\n\f                        Cite as: 603 U.

The majority shoos away this possibility.\nAnte, at 637 (accusing the dissents of \u201cstrik[ing] a tone of\nchilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the\nCourt actually does today\u201d). But Justice Sotomayor\nmakes this point plain, see ante, at 684\u2013685, and I will not\nbelabor it.\n  Here, I will merely observe that, from a theoretical per-\nspective, philosophers have long considered deterrence to be\na key justifcation for adopting and maintaining systems that\nensure accountability for criminal conduct.7 For that same\nreason, some commentators also maintain that decreasing\nthe certainty of accountability for wrongful acts at least ar-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nguably reduces incentives to follow the law.8\n  Under the individual accountability model, because every-\none is subject to the law, the potential of criminal liability\noperates as a constraint on the actions and decisions of ev-\neryone, including the President. After today, that reality is\nno more. Consequently, our Nation has lost a substantial\n\n  7\n     See, e. g., Plato, Laws 274 (B. Jowett transl. 2000) (\u201cNot that he is pun-\nished because he did wrong, for that which is done can never be undone,\nbut in order that in future times, he, and those who see him corrected,\nmay utterly hate injustice, or at any rate abate much of their evil-doing\u201d);\nsee also J. Bentham, The Rationale of Punishment 20 (1830) (\u201cGeneral pre-\nvention ought to be the chief end of punishment, as it is its real justifca-\ntion\u201d); A. von Hirsch, Doing Justice: The Choice of Punishments 44 (1976)\n(\u201cThe threat and imposition of punishment is called for in order to secure\ncompliance\u2014not full compliance, but more compliance than there might be\nwere there no legal penalties at all\u201d).\n   8\n     See, e. g., M. Ryan, Taking Another Look at Second-Look Sentencing,\n81 Brooklyn L. Rev. 149, 156, and n. 37 (2015) (\u201c[U]ndermining the . . .\ncertainty of punishment . . . could undermine the deterrence value of\npunishment\u201d).\n\f702               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Jackson, J., dissenting\n\ncheck on Presidents who would use their offcial powers to\ncommit crimes with impunity while in offce.\n   So, one might ask, what remains of accountability for Pres-\nidents under law? With today's paradigm shift, the major-\nity leaves in place only the chance that this Court might\nsomeday determine that the criminal conduct in question\nwas an \u201cunoffcial\u201d act, or that the Government will somehow\nrebut the presumption of immunity that applies to a Presi-\ndent's offcial acts, such that criminal consequences might\nattach. But with the parameters of offcial and unoffcial\nconduct unknown, I think it highly unlikely that a sitting\nPresident would feel constrained by these remote\npossibilities.\n   All of this leads me to ponder why, exactly, has the major-\nity concluded that an indeterminate \u201ccore\u201d-versus-\u201coffcial\u201d-\nversus-\u201cunoffcial\u201d line-drawing exercise is the better way to\naddress potential criminal acts of a President? Could it be\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthat the majority believes the obviously grave dangers of\nshifting from the individual accountability model to the Pres-\nidential accountability model might nevertheless be offset by\nthe great benefts of doing so? Cf. J. Bentham, A Fragment\non Government and an Introduction to the Principles of Mor-\nals and Legislation 3 (W. Harrison ed. 1948) (arguing that\nacts can be justifed by the maxim that \u201cit is the greatest\nhappiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right\nand wrong\u201d (emphasis deleted)).\n   Some of the majority's analysis suggests as much. As far\nas I can tell, the majority is mostly concerned that, without\nimmunity, Presidents might \u201cbe chilled from taking the `bold\nand unhesitating action' required of an independent Execu-\ntive.\u201d Ante, at 613. The Court's opinion candidly laments\nthat application of the law to Presidents might not be even-\nhanded, and that, as a result, Presidents might be less \u201c `vig-\norous' and `energetic' \u201d as executive offcers. Ante, at 610; ac-\ncord, ante, at 639. But that concern ignores (or rejects) the\nfoundational principles upon which the traditional individual\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U. S. 593 (2024)             703\n\n                      Jackson, J., dissenting\n\naccountability paradigm is based. Worse still, promoting\nmore vigor from Presidents in exercising their offcial du-\nties\u2014and, presumably, less deliberation\u2014invites breathtak-\ning risks in terms of harm to the American people that, in\nmy view, far outweigh the benefts.\n   This is not to say that the majority is wrong when it per-\nceives that it can be cumbersome for a President to have to\nfollow the law while carrying out his duty to enforce it. It\nis certainly true that \u201c[a] scheme of government like ours\nno doubt at times feels the lack of power to act with com-\nplete, all-embracing, swiftly moving authority.\u201d Youngs-\ntown, 343 U. S., at 613 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). But\nany American who has studied history knows that \u201cour gov-\nernment was designed to have such restrictions.\u201d Ibid. (em-\nphasis added). Our Constitution's \u201cseparation of powers\nwas adopted by the Convention of 1787, not to promote effci-\nency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The\nPage Proof Pending Publication\npurpose was, not to avoid friction, but . . . to save the people\nfrom autocracy.\u201d Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 293\n(1926) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).\n   Having now cast the shadow of doubt over when\u2014if\never\u2014a former President will be subject to criminal liability\nfor any criminal conduct he engages in while on duty, the\nmajority incentivizes all future Presidents to cross the line\nof criminality while in offce, knowing that unless they act\n\u201cmanifestly or palpably beyond [their] authority,\u201d ante, at\n618, they will be presumed above prosecution and punish-\nment alike.\n   But the majority also tells us not to worry, because \u201c[l]ike\neveryone else, the President is subject to prosecution in his\nunoffcial capacity.\u201d Ante, at 639 (emphasis added). This\nattempted reassurance is cold comfort, even setting aside the\nfact that the Court has neglected to lay out a standard that\nreliably distinguishes between a President's offcial and unof-\nfcial conduct. Why? Because there is still manifest ineq-\nuity: Presidents alone are now free to commit crimes when\n\f704               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Jackson, J., dissenting\n\nthey are on the job, while all other Americans must follow\nthe law in all aspects of their lives, whether personal or pro-\nfessional. The offcial-versus-unoffcial act distinction also\nseems both arbitrary and irrational, for it suggests that the\nunoffcial criminal acts of a President are the only ones wor-\nthy of prosecution. Quite to the contrary, it is when the\nPresident commits crimes using his unparalleled offcial pow-\ners that the risks of abuse and autocracy will be most dire.\nSo, the fact that, \u201cunlike anyone else, the President is\u201d\nvested with \u201csweeping powers and duties,\u201d ante, at 639\u2013640,\nactually underscores, rather than undermines, the grim\nstakes of setting the criminal law to the side when the Presi-\ndent fexes those very powers.\n   The vision John Adams enshrined in the Massachusetts\nDeclaration of Rights\u2014\u201c `a government of laws and not of\nmen' \u201d\u2014speaks directly to this concept. Mine Workers, 330\nU. S., at 307 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment).\nAdams characterized that document as an homage to the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nRule of Law; it refected both a fat \u201crejection in positive\nterms of rule by fat\u201d and a solemn promise that \u201c[e]very act\nof government may be challenged by an appeal to law.\u201d Id.,\nat 308. Thanks to the majority, that vision and promise\nare likely to be feeting in the future. From this day for-\nward, Presidents of tomorrow will be free to exercise the\nCommander-in-Chief powers, the foreign-affairs powers, and\nall the vast law enforcement powers enshrined in Article II\nhowever they please\u2014including in ways that Congress has\ndeemed criminal and that have potentially grave conse-\nquences for the rights and liberties of Americans.\n\n                              IV\n  To the extent that the majority's new accountability para-\ndigm allows Presidents to evade punishment for their crim-\ninal acts while in offce, the seeds of absolute power for\nPresidents have been planted. And, without a doubt, abso-\nlute power corrupts absolutely. \u201cIf one man can be allowed\n\f                   Cite as: 603 U.

S., at 485\n(Brandeis, J., dissenting). I worry that, after today's ruling,\nour Nation will reap what this Court has sown.\n   Stated simply: The Court has now declared for the frst\ntime in history that the most powerful offcial in the United\nStates can (under circumstances yet to be fully determined)\nbecome a law unto himself. As we enter this uncharted ter-\nritory, the People, in their wisdom, will need to remain ever\nattentive, consistently fulflling their established role in our\nconstitutional democracy, and thus collectively serving as the\nultimate safeguard against any chaos spawned by this\nCourt's decision. For, like our democracy, our Constitution\nis \u201cthe creature of their will, and lives only by their will.\u201d\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nCohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 389 (1821).\n   For my part, I simply cannot abide the majority's senseless\ndiscarding of a model of accountability for criminal acts that\ntreats every citizen of this country as being equally subject\nto the law\u2014as the Rule of Law requires. That core princi-\nple has long prevented our Nation from devolving into despo-\ntism. Yet the Court now opts to let down the guardrails of\nthe law for one extremely powerful category of citizen: any\nfuture President who has the will to fout Congress's estab-\nlished boundaries.\n   In short, America has traditionally relied on the law to\nkeep its Presidents in line. Starting today, however, Ameri-\ncans must rely on the courts to determine when (if at all)\nthe criminal laws that their representatives have enacted to\npromote individual and collective security will operate as\nspeedbumps to Presidential action or reaction. Once self-\nregulating, the Rule of Law now becomes the rule of judges,\nwith courts pronouncing which crimes committed by a Presi-\ndent have to be let go and which can be redressed as imper-\n\f706              TRUMP v.

So, ultimately, this Court itself will decide\nwhether the law will be any barrier to whatever course of\ncriminality emanates from the Oval Offce in the future.\nThe potential for great harm to American institutions and\nAmericans themselves is obvious.\n                       *      *      *\n  The majority of my colleagues seems to have put their\ntrust in our Court's ability to prevent Presidents from be-\ncoming Kings through case-by-case application of the inde-\nterminate standards of their new Presidential accountability\nparadigm.

But, for all our\nsakes, I hope that they are right.\n  In the meantime, because the risks (and power) the Court\nhas now assumed are intolerable, unwarranted, and plainly\nantithetical to bedrock constitutional norms, I dissent.\n\n\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n\f                            Reporter\u2019s Note\n\n  The attached opinion has been revised to refect the usual publication\nand citation style of the United States Reports.

Argued April 25, 2024\u2014Decided July 1, 2024\nA federal grand jury indicted former President Donald J. Trump on four\n  counts for conduct that occurred during his Presidency following the\n  November 2020 election. The indictment alleged that after losing that\n  election, Trump conspired to overturn it by spreading knowingly false\n  claims of election fraud to obstruct the collecting, counting, and certify-\n  ing of the election results. Trump moved to dismiss the indictment\n  based on Presidential immunity, arguing that a President has absolute\n  immunity from criminal prosecution for actions performed within the\n  outer perimeter of his offcial responsibilities, and that the indictment&#x27;s\n  allegations fell within the core of his offcial duties. The District Court\n  denied Trump&#x27;s motion to dismiss, holding that former Presidents do\n  not possess federal criminal immunity for any acts. The D. C. Circuit\n  affrmed. Both the District Court and the D. C. Circuit declined to de-\nPage        Proof Pending Publication\n  cide whether the indicted conduct involved offcial acts.\nHeld: Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature\n  of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity\n  from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclu-\n  sive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive\n  immunity from prosecution for all his offcial acts. There is no immu-\n  nity for unoffcial acts. Pp. 605\u2013642.\n     (a) This case is the frst criminal prosecution in our Nation&#x27;s history\n  of a former President for actions taken during his Presidency. Deter-\n  mining whether and under what circumstances such a prosecution may\n  proceed requires careful assessment of the scope of Presidential power\n  under the Constitution. The nature of that power requires that a for-\n  mer President have some immunity from criminal prosecution for offcial\n  acts during his tenure in offce. At least with respect to the President&#x27;s\n  exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be abso-\n  lute. As for his remaining offcial actions, he is entitled to at least pre-\n  sumptive immunity.

When the President exercises such authority,\n  Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President&#x27;s ac-\n  tions. It follows that an Act of Congress\u2014either a specifc one targeted\n  at the President or a generally applicable one\u2014may not criminalize the\n  President&#x27;s actions within his exclusive constitutional power. Neither\n  may the courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution that examines such\n  Presidential actions. The Court thus concludes that the President is\n  absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for conduct within his ex-\n  clusive sphere of constitutional authority. Pp. 607\u2013609.\n       (2) Not all of the President&#x27;s offcial acts fall within his \u201cconclusive\n  and preclusive\u201d authority.

To determine the Presi-\n  dent&#x27;s immunity in this context, the Court looks primarily to the Fram-\n  ers&#x27; design of the Presidency within the separation of powers, precedent\n  on Presidential immunity in the civil context, and criminal cases where a\n  President resisted prosecutorial demands for documents.

The danger is greater than what led the Court to recognize\n absolute Presidential immunity from civil damages liability\u2014that the\n President would be chilled from taking the \u201cbold and unhesitating ac-\n tion\u201d required of an independent Executive.

Such an immunity is required to safeguard the inde-\n pendence and effective functioning of the Executive Branch, and to en-\n able the President to carry out his constitutional duties without undue\n caution. At a minimum, the President must be immune from prosecu-\n tion for an offcial act unless the Government can show that applying a\n criminal prohibition to that act would pose no \u201cdangers of intrusion on\n the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.\u201d Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9428860\"><a href=\"/opinion/110762/nixon-v-fitzgerald/#754\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Nixon v.

Pp. 615\u2013616.\n     (b) The frst step in deciding whether a former President is entitled\n  to immunity from a particular prosecution is to distinguish his offcial\n  from unoffcial actions. In this case, no court thus far has drawn that\n  distinction, in general or with respect to the conduct alleged in particu-\n  lar. It is therefore incumbent upon the Court to be mindful that it is\n  \u201ca court of fnal review and not frst view.\u201d Zivotofsky v.

Critical threshold issues in this case are how to differen-\n  tiate between a President&#x27;s offcial and unoffcial actions, and how to do\n  so with respect to the indictment&#x27;s extensive and detailed allegations\n  covering a broad range of conduct. The Court offers guidance on those\n  issues. Pp. 616\u2013632.\n       (1) When the President acts pursuant to \u201cconstitutional and statu-\n  tory authority,\u201d he takes offcial action to perform the functions of his\n  offce. Fitzgerald, 456 U. S., at 757. Determining whether an action is\n  covered by immunity thus begins with assessing the President&#x27;s author-\n  ity to take that action. But the breadth of the President&#x27;s \u201cdiscretion-\n  ary responsibilities\u201d under the Constitution and laws of the United\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n  States frequently makes it \u201cdiffcult to determine which of [his] innu-\n  merable `functions&#x27; encompassed a particular action.\u201d Id., at 756. The\n  immunity the Court has recognized therefore extends to the \u201couter pe-\n  rimeter\u201d of the President&#x27;s offcial responsibilities, covering actions so\n  long as they are \u201cnot manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.\u201d\n  Blassingame v. Trump, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">87 F. 4th 1</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (CADC).\n     In dividing offcial from unoffcial conduct, courts may not inquire into\n  the President&#x27;s motives.

According to\n the indictment, Trump met with the Acting Attorney General and other\n senior Justice Department and White House offcials to discuss investi-\n gating purported election fraud and sending a letter from the Depart-\n ment to those States regarding such fraud. The indictment further al-\n leges that after the Acting Attorney General resisted Trump&#x27;s requests,\n Trump repeatedly threatened to replace him.\n    The Government does not dispute that the indictment&#x27;s allegations\n regarding the Justice Department involve Trump&#x27;s use of offcial power.\n The allegations in fact plainly implicate Trump&#x27;s \u201cconclusive and preclu-\n sive\u201d authority.

The\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n indictment&#x27;s allegations that the requested investigations were shams\n or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of ex-\n clusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of\n the Justice Department and its offcials. Because the President can-\n not be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional author-\n ity, Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged con-\n duct involving his discussions with Justice Department offcials.\n Pp. 619\u2013621.\n        (ii) The indictment next alleges that Trump and his co-\n conspirators \u201cattempted to enlist the Vice President to use his ceremo-\n nial role at the January 6 certifcation proceeding to fraudulently alter\n the election results.\u201d App. 187, Indictment \u00b610(d). In particular, the\n indictment alleges several conversations in which Trump pressured the\n Vice President to reject States&#x27; legitimate electoral votes or send them\n back to state legislatures for review.\n    Whenever the President and Vice President discuss their offcial re-\n sponsibilities, they engage in offcial conduct. Presiding over the Janu-\n ary 6 certifcation proceeding at which Members of Congress count the\n electoral votes is a constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice Presi-\n dent. Art.

The indictment&#x27;s alle-\n gations that Trump attempted to pressure the Vice President to take\n particular acts in connection with his role at the certifcation proceeding\n\f598                   TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n  thus involve offcial conduct, and Trump is at least presumptively im-\n  mune from prosecution for such conduct.\n     The question then becomes whether that presumption of immunity is\n  rebutted under the circumstances. It is the Government&#x27;s burden to\n  rebut the presumption of immunity. The Court therefore remands to\n  the District Court to assess in the frst instance whether a prosecution\n  involving Trump&#x27;s alleged attempts to infuence the Vice President&#x27;s\n  oversight of the certifcation proceeding would pose any dangers of\n  intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.\n  Pp. 621\u2013625.\n         (iii) The indictment&#x27;s remaining allegations involve Trump&#x27;s in-\n  teractions with persons outside the Executive Branch: state offcials,\n  private parties, and the general public. In particular, the indictment\n  alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to convince cer-\n  tain state offcials that election fraud had tainted the popular vote count\n  in their States, and thus electoral votes for Trump&#x27;s opponent needed to\n  be changed to electoral votes for Trump. After Trump failed to convince\n  those offcials to alter their state processes, he and his co-conspirators al-\n  legedly developed and effectuated a plan to submit fraudulent slates of\n  Presidential electors to obstruct the certifcation proceeding. On\n  Trump&#x27;s view, the alleged conduct qualifes as offcial because it was\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n  undertaken to ensure the integrity and proper administration of the\n  federal election. As the Government sees it, however, Trump can point\n  to no plausible source of authority enabling the President to take such ac-\n  tions. Determining whose characterization may be correct, and with re-\n  spect to which conduct, requires a fact-specifc analysis of the indictment&#x27;s\n  extensive and interrelated allegations. The Court accordingly remands\n  to the District Court to determine in the frst instance whether Trump&#x27;s\n  conduct in this area qualifes as offcial or unoffcial. Pp. 625\u2013628.\n         (iv) The indictment also contains various allegations regarding\n  Trump&#x27;s conduct in connection with the events of January 6 itself. The\n  alleged conduct largely consists of Trump&#x27;s communications in the form\n  of Tweets and a public address. The President possesses \u201cextraordi-\n  nary power to speak to his fellow citizens and on their behalf.\u201d Trump\n  v. Hawaii, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">585 U.

But\n the text of the Clause does not address whether and on what conduct a\n President may be prosecuted if he was never impeached and convicted.\n See Art. I, \u00a7 3, cl. 7. Historical evidence likewise lends little support to\n Trump&#x27;s position. The Federalist Papers on which Trump relies con-\n cerned the checks available against a sitting President; they did not\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n endorse or even consider whether the Impeachment Judgment Clause\n immunizes a former President from prosecution. Transforming the po-\n litical process of impeachment into a necessary step in the enforcement\n of criminal law fnds little support in the text of the Constitution or the\n structure of the Nation&#x27;s Government. Pp. 632\u2013634.\n    (d) The Government takes a similarly broad view, contending that the\n President enjoys no immunity from criminal prosecution for any action.\n On its view, as-applied challenges in the course of the trial suffce to\n protect Article II interests, and review of a district court&#x27;s decisions on\n such challenges should be deferred until after trial. But questions\n about whether the President may be held liable for particular actions,\n consistent with the separation of powers, must be addressed at the out-\n set of a proceeding. Even if the President were ultimately not found\n liable for certain offcial actions, the possibility of an extended proceed-\n ing alone may render him \u201cunduly cautious in the discharge of his offcial\n duties.\u201d Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9428860\"><a href=\"/opinion/110762/nixon-v-fitzgerald/#752\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Nixon v.

Trump\nserved as President of the United States. On August 1,\n2023, a federal grand jury indicted him on four counts for\nconduct that occurred during his Presidency following the\nNovember 2020 election. The indictment alleged that after\nlosing that election, Trump conspired to overturn it by\nspreading knowingly false claims of election fraud to ob-\nstruct the collecting, counting, and certifying of the election\nresults.\n   According to the indictment, Trump advanced his goal\nthrough five primary means. First, he and his co-\nconspirators \u201cused knowingly false claims of election fraud to\nget state legislators and election offcials to . . . change elec-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ntoral votes for [Trump&#x27;s] opponent, Joseph R.

Third, Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to\nuse the Justice Department \u201cto conduct sham election crime\ninvestigations and to send a letter to the targeted states that\nfalsely claimed that the Justice Department had identifed\nsignifcant concerns that may have impacted the election out-\n\nliger III, John S.

The frst\nstep is to distinguish his offcial from unoffcial actions. In\nthis case, however, no court has thus far considered how to\ndraw that distinction, in general or with respect to the con-\nduct alleged in particular.\n   Despite the unprecedented nature of this case, and the\nvery signifcant constitutional questions that it raises, the\nlower courts rendered their decisions on a highly expedited\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nbasis. Because those courts categorically rejected any form\nof Presidential immunity, they did not analyze the conduct\nalleged in the indictment to decide which of it should be cate-\ngorized as offcial and which unoffcial. Neither party has\nbriefed that issue before us (though they discussed it at oral\nargument in response to questions). And like the underly-\ning immunity question, that categorization raises multiple\nunprecedented and momentous questions about the powers\nof the President and the limits of his authority under the\nConstitution.

We\noffer guidance on those issues below. Certain allegations\u2014\nsuch as those involving Trump&#x27;s discussions with the Acting\nAttorney General\u2014are readily categorized in light of the na-\nture of the President&#x27;s offcial relationship to the offce held\nby that individual. Other allegations\u2014such as those involv-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ning Trump&#x27;s interactions with the Vice President, state off-\ncials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the\ngeneral public\u2014present more diffcult questions. Although\nwe identify several considerations pertinent to classifying\nthose allegations and determining whether they are subject\nto immunity, that analysis ultimately is best left to the lower\ncourts to perform in the frst instance.\n\n                                A\n   Distinguishing the President&#x27;s offcial actions from his un-\noffcial ones can be diffcult.

Many of\nthe remaining allegations, for instance, cover at great length\nevents arising out of communications that Trump and his co-\nconspirators initiated with state legislators and election offi-\ncials in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wis-\nconsin regarding those States&#x27; certification of electors. See\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nApp. 192\u2013207, Indictment \u00b6\u00b613\u201352.\n   Specifcally, the indictment alleges that Trump and his co-\nconspirators attempted to convince those offcials that elec-\ntion fraud had tainted the popular vote count in their States,\nand thus electoral votes for Trump&#x27;s opponent needed to be\nchanged to electoral votes for Trump.

On the same day that the legiti-\nmate electors met in their respective jurisdictions to cast\ntheir votes, the indictment alleges that Trump&#x27;s \u201cfraudulent\nelectors convened sham proceedings in the seven targeted\nstates to cast fraudulent electoral ballots\u201d in his favor.

See\nApp. 192\u2013215, Indictment \u00b6\u00b613\u201369. Unlike Trump&#x27;s alleged\ninteractions with the Justice Department, this alleged con-\nduct cannot be neatly categorized as falling within a particu-\nlar Presidential function. The necessary analysis is instead\nfact specifc, requiring assessment of numerous alleged inter-\nactions with a wide variety of state offcials and private per-\nsons. And the parties&#x27; brief comments at oral argument in-\ndicate that they starkly disagree on the characterization of\nthese allegations. The concerns we noted at the outset\u2014\nthe expedition of this case, the lack of factual analysis by\nthe lower courts, and the absence of pertinent briefng by\nthe parties\u2014thus become more prominent.

It alleges that leading up to the January 6\ncertifcation proceeding, Trump issued a series of Tweets (to\nhis nearly 89 million followers) encouraging his supporters\nto travel to Washington, D.

As the sole\nperson charged by the Constitution with executing the laws\nof the United States, the President oversees\u2014and thus will\nfrequently speak publicly about\u2014a vast array of activities\nthat touch on nearly every aspect of American life. Indeed,\na long-recognized aspect of Presidential power is using the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\noffce&#x27;s \u201cbully pulpit\u201d to persuade Americans, including by\nspeaking forcefully or critically, in ways that the President\nbelieves would advance the public interest. He is even ex-\npected to comment on those matters of public concern that\nmay not directly implicate the activities of the Federal Gov-\nernment\u2014for instance, to comfort the Nation in the wake\nof an emergency or tragedy. For these reasons, most of a\nPresident&#x27;s public communications are likely to fall comfort-\nably within the outer perimeter of his offcial responsibilities.\n   There may, however, be contexts in which the President,\nnotwithstanding the prominence of his position, speaks in an\nunoffcial capacity\u2014perhaps as a candidate for offce or party\nleader.

Whether the\nTweets, that speech, and Trump&#x27;s other communications on\nJanuary 6 involve offcial conduct may depend on the content\nand context of each. Knowing, for instance, what else was\nsaid contemporaneous to the excerpted communications, or\nwho was involved in transmitting the electronic communica-\ntions and in organizing the rally, could be relevant to the\nclassifcation of each communication.

But of\ncourse the prosecutor may point to the public record to show the fact that\nthe President performed the offcial act.

See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U. S. C. \u00a7 201</span><pre class=\"inline\">(b)(2). What the prosecutor may not\ndo, however, is admit testimony or private records of the President or his\nadvisers probing the offcial act itself.

By its own terms, the\nClause does not address whether and on what conduct a\nPresident may be prosecuted if he was never impeached\nand convicted.\n   Historical evidence likewise lends little support to\nTrump&#x27;s position. For example, Justice Story reasoned that\nwithout the Clause&#x27;s clarifcation that \u201cIndictment, Trial,\nJudgment and Punishment\u201d may nevertheless follow Senate\nconviction, \u201cit might be matter of extreme doubt, whether\n. . . a second trial for the same offence could be had, either\nafter an acquittal, or a conviction in the court of impeach-\nments.\u201d 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of\nthe United States \u00a7 780, p. 251 (1833). James Wilson, who\nserved on the Committee that drafted the Clause and later\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nas a Justice of this Court, similarly concluded that acquittal\nof impeachment charges posed no bar to subsequent prosecu-\ntion. See 2 Documentary History of the Ratifcation of the\nConstitution 492 (M. Jensen ed. 1976). And contrary to\nTrump&#x27;s contention, Alexander Hamilton did not disagree.\nThe Federalist Papers on which Trump relies, see Brief for\nPetitioner 17\u201318, concerned the checks available against a\nsitting President. Hamilton noted that unlike \u201cthe King of\nGreat-Britain,\u201d the President \u201cwould be liable to be im-\npeached\u201d and \u201cremoved from offce,\u201d and \u201cwould afterwards\nbe liable to prosecution and punishment.\u201d The Federalist\nNo. 69, at 463; see also id., No. 77, at 520 (explaining that\nthe President is \u201cat all times liable to impeachment, trial,\ndismission from offce . . . and to the forfeiture of life and\nestate by subsequent prosecution\u201d). Hamilton did not en-\ndorse or even consider whether the Impeachment Judgment\nClause immunizes a former President from prosecution.\n   The implication of Trump&#x27;s theory is that a President who\nevades impeachment for one reason or another during his\n\f634               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nterm in offce can never be held accountable for his criminal\nacts in the ordinary course of law. So if a President man-\nages to conceal certain crimes throughout his Presidency, or\nif Congress is unable to muster the political will to impeach\nthe President for his crimes, then they must forever remain\nimpervious to prosecution.\n   Impeachment is a political process by which Congress can\nremove a President who has committed \u201cTreason, Bribery,\nor other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d Art. II, \u00a7 4.\nTransforming that political process into a necessary step in\nthe enforcement of criminal law fnds little support in the\ntext of the Constitution or the structure of our Government.\n\n                               B\n   The Government for its part takes a similarly broad view,\ncontending that the President enjoys no immunity from\ncriminal prosecution for any action. It maintains this view\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ndespite agreeing with much of our analysis.\n   For instance, the Government does not dispute that Con-\ngress may not criminalize Presidential conduct within the\nPresident&#x27;s \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d constitutional author-\nity. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 133 (\u201c[C]ore powers . . . can&#x27;t be\nregulated at all, like the pardon power and veto.\u201d); see also\nid., at 84\u201385. And it too accords protection to Presidential\nconduct if subjecting that conduct to generally applicable\nlaws would \u201craise serious constitutional questions regarding\nthe President&#x27;s authority\u201d or cause a \u201cpossible confict with\nthe President&#x27;s constitutional prerogatives.\u201d Application of\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U.

So it\nviewed such a statute as not applying to the President.\nLikewise, it has narrowly construed a criminal prohibition\non grassroots lobbying to avoid the constitutional issues that\nwould otherwise arise, reasoning that the statute should not\n\u201cbe construed to prohibit the President or executive branch\nagencies from engaging in a general open dialogue with the\npublic on the Administration&#x27;s programs and policies.\u201d Con-\nstraints Imposed by </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.

See Tr. of Oral\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nArg. 125; cf. id., at 128.\n   Yet the Government contends that the President should\nnot be considered immune from prosecution for those offcial\nacts. See Brief for United States 9. On the Government&#x27;s\nview, as-applied challenges in the course of the trial suffce\nto protect Article II interests, and review of a district court&#x27;s\ndecisions on such challenges should be deferred until after\ntrial. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 69, 79\u201380, 154\u2013158. If the Presi-\ndent is instead immune from prosecution, a district court&#x27;s\ndenial of immunity would be appealable before trial. See\nMitchell, 472 U.

See post, at\n671\u2013672 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.); Brief for United States\n24\u201330.

Take\nthe President&#x27;s alleged attempt to organize alternative slates of electors.\nSee, e. g., App. 208. In my view, that conduct is private and therefore not\nentitled to protection. See post, at 682\u2013683 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).\nThe Constitution vests power to appoint Presidential electors in the\nStates. Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2; see also Chiafalo v.

The\nmajority thinks he should, and so it invents an atextual, ahis-\ntorical, and unjustifable immunity that puts the President\nabove the law.\n   The majority makes three moves that, in effect, completely\ninsulate Presidents from criminal liability. First, the major-\nity creates absolute immunity for the President&#x27;s exercise of\n\u201ccore constitutional powers.\u201d Ante, at 606. This holding is\nunnecessary on the facts of the indictment, and the majori-\nty&#x27;s attempt to apply it to the facts expands the concept of\ncore powers beyond any recognizable bounds. In any event,\nit is quickly eclipsed by the second move, which is to create\nexpansive immunity for all \u201coffcial act[s].\u201d Ante, at 615.\nWhether described as presumptive or absolute, under the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nmajority&#x27;s rule, a President&#x27;s use of any offcial power for any\npurpose, even the most corrupt, is immune from prosecution.\nThat is just as bad as it sounds, and it is baseless. Finally,\nthe majority declares that evidence concerning acts for\nwhich the President is immune can play no role in any crimi-\nnal prosecution against him. See ante, at 630\u2013632. That\nholding, which will prevent the Government from using a\nPresident&#x27;s offcial acts to prove knowledge or intent in pros-\necuting private offenses, is nonsensical.\n   Argument by argument, the majority invents immunity\nthrough brute force. Under scrutiny, its arguments crum-\nble. To start, the majority&#x27;s broad \u201coffcial acts\u201d immu-\nnity is inconsistent with text, history, and established un-\nderstandings of the President&#x27;s role. See Part III, infra.\nMoreover, it is deeply wrong, even on its own functionalist\nterms. See Part IV, infra. Next, the majority&#x27;s \u201ccore\u201d im-\nmunity is both unnecessary and misguided. See Part V,\nin fra. Furthermore, the majority&#x27;s illogical evidentiary\n\f660                TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nholding is unprecedented. See Part VI, infra. Finally, this\nmajority&#x27;s project will have disastrous consequences for the\nPresidency and for our democracy. See Part VII, infra.\n\n                               III\n   The main takeaway of today&#x27;s decision is that all of a Pres-\nident&#x27;s offcial acts, defned without regard to motive or\nintent, are entitled to immunity that is \u201cat least . . . presump-\ntive,\u201d ante, at 614, and quite possibly \u201cabsolute\u201d, ante, at 615.\nWhenever the President wields the enormous power of his\noffce, the majority says, the criminal law (at least presump-\ntively) cannot touch him. This offcial-acts immunity has\n\u201cno frm grounding in constitutional text, history, or prece-\ndent.\u201d Dobbs v.

I would start there.\n   The Constitution&#x27;s text contains no provision for immunity\nfrom criminal prosecution for former Presidents.

The\nomission in the text of the Constitution is worth noting, how-\never, for at least three reasons.\n   First, the Framers clearly knew how to provide for immu-\nnity from prosecution.

They did not\nextend the same or similar immunity to Presidents.\n   Second, \u201csome state constitutions at the time of the Fram-\ning specifcally provided `express criminal immunities&#x27; to sit-\nting governors.\u201d Brief for Scholars of Constitutional Law\nas Amici Curiae 4 (quoting S.

If the Framers\n\u201chad wanted to create some constitutional privilege to shield\nthe President . . . from criminal indictment,\u201d they could have\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ndone so. Memorandum from R. Rotunda to K. Starr re: In-\ndictability of the President 18 (May 13, 1998). They did not.\n   Third, insofar as the Constitution does speak to this ques-\ntion, it actually contemplates some form of criminal liability\nfor former Presidents. The majority correctly re jects\nTrump&#x27;s argument that a former President cannot be prose-\ncuted unless he has been impeached by the House and con-\nvicted by the Senate for the same conduct. See ante, at\n632\u2013634; Part IV\u2013C, infra. The majority ignores, however,\nthat the Impeachment Judgment Clause cuts against its own\nposition. That Clause presumes the availability of criminal\nprocess as a backstop by establishing that an offcial im-\npeached and convicted by the Senate \u201cshall nevertheless be\nliable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Pun-\nishment, according to Law.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 3, cl. 7 (emphasis\nadded). That Clause clearly contemplates that a former\nPresident may be subject to criminal prosecution for the\nsame conduct that resulted (or could have resulted) in an\nimpeachment judgment\u2014including conduct such as \u201cBrib-\n\f662                  TRUMP v.

S., at 749). That is true,\nas far as it goes. Nothing in our history, however, supports\nthe majority&#x27;s entirely novel immunity from criminal prose-\ncution for offcial acts.\n   The historical evidence that exists on Presidential immu-\nnity from criminal prosecution cuts decisively against it.\nFor instance, Alexander Hamilton wrote that former Presi-\ndents would be \u201cliable to prosecution and punishment in the\nordinary course of law.\u201d The Federalist No. 69, p. 452 (J.\nHarv. Lib. ed. 2009). For Hamilton, that was an important\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ndistinction between \u201cthe king of Great Britain,\u201d who was\n\u201csacred and inviolable,\u201d and the \u201cPresident of the United\nStates,\u201d who \u201cwould be amenable to personal punishment\nand disgrace.\u201d Id., at 458. In contrast to the king, the\nPresident should be subject to \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d for\nhis actions, \u201cstand[ing] upon no better ground than a gover-\nnor of New York, and upon worse ground than the governors\nof Maryland and Delaware,\u201d whose State Constitutions gave\nthem some immunity. Id., at 452.\n   At the Constitutional Convention, James Madison, who\nwas aware that some state constitutions provided governors\nimmunity, proposed that the Convention \u201cconside[r] what\nprivileges ought to be allowed to the Executive.\u201d 2 Records\nof the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 503 (M. Farrand ed.\n1911). There is no record of any such discussion. Ibid.\n  1\n    Article II, \u00a7 4, provides: \u201cThe President, Vice President and all Civil\nOffcers of the United States, shall be removed from Offce on Impeach-\nment for and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and\nMisdemeanors.\u201d\n\f                      Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">603 U.

James Wilson\nrecognized that federal offcers who use their offcial powers\nto commit crimes \u201cmay be tried by their country; and if their\ncriminality is established, the law will punish. A grand jury\nmay present, a petty jury may convict, and the judges will\npronounce the punishment.\u201d 2 Debates on the Constitution\n477 (J. Elliot ed. 1836). A few decades later, Justice Story\nevinced the same understanding. He explained that, when\na federal offcial commits a crime in offce, \u201cit is indispensa-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nble, that provision should be made, that the common tribu-\nnals of justice should be at liberty to entertain jurisdiction\nof the offence, for the purpose of inficting the common pun-\nishment applicable to unoffcial offenders.\u201d 2 Commentaries\non the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 780, pp. 250\u2013251\n(1833). Without a criminal trial, he explained, \u201cthe grossest\noffcial offenders might escape without any substantial pun-\nishment, even for crimes, which would subject their fellow\ncitizens to capital punishment.\u201d Id., at 251.\n   This historical evidence reinforces that, from the very be-\nginning, the presumption in this Nation has always been that\n\n  2\n    To note, as the majority does, see ante, at 639, that this Court has\nrecognized civil immunities arguably inconsistent with this view is not to\nsay that Pinckney was wrong about what the Framers had \u201cintended.\u201d\nIndeed, Pinckney&#x27;s contemporaries shared the same view during the rati-\nfcation debates. See, e. g., 4 Debates on the Constitution 109 (J. Elliot\ned. 1836) (J. Iredell) (\u201cIf the President does a single act by which the\npeople are prejudiced, he is punishable himself. . . . If he commits any\ncrime, he is punishable by the laws of his country\u201d).\n\f664               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nno man is free to fout the criminal law. The majority fails\nto recognize or grapple with the lack of historical evidence\nfor its new immunity. With nothing on its side of the ledger,\nthe most the majority can do is claim that the historical evi-\ndence is a wash. See ante, at 638\u2013639. It claims that the\nCourt previously has described the \u201crelevant historical evi-\ndence on the question of Presidential immunity\u201d as \u201c `frag-\nmentary&#x27; \u201d and not worthy of consideration. Ante, at 638\n(quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 752, n. 31). Yet the Court\nhas described only the evidence regarding \u201cthe President&#x27;s\nimmunity from damages liability\u201d as \u201cfragmentary.\u201d Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U. S., at 751\u2013752, n. 31 (emphasis added). More-\nover, far from dismissing that evidence as irrelevant, the\nFitzgerald Court was careful to note that \u201c[t]he best histori-\ncal evidence clearly support[ed]\u201d the immunity from dam-\nages liability that it recognized, and it relied in part on that\nhistorical evidence to overcome the lack of any textual basis\nfor its immunity. Id., at 752, n. 31. The majority ignores\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthis reliance. It seems history matters to this Court only\nwhen it is convenient. See, e. g., New York State Rife &amp;\nPistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">597 U.

It says that whenever the Presi-\ndent acts in a way that is \u201c `not manifestly or palpably be-\nyond [his] authority,&#x27; \u201d he is taking offcial action.

Under that rule, any use of off-\ncial power for any purpose, even the most corrupt purpose\nindicated by objective evidence of the most corrupt motives\nand intent, remains offcial and immune. Under the majori-\nty&#x27;s test, if it can be called a test, the category of Presidential\naction that can be deemed \u201cunoffcial\u201d is destined to be van-\nishingly small.\n   Ultimately, the majority pays lip service to the idea that\n\u201c[t]he President, charged with enforcing federal criminal\nlaws, is not above them,\u201d ante, at 614, but it then proceeds\nto place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal\ncriminal laws for any abuse of offcial power.\n\n                                B\n  So how does the majority get to its rule?

In\ndoing so, it decontextualizes Fitzgerald&#x27;s language, ignores\nimportant qualifcations, and reaches a result that the Fitz-\ngerald Court never would have countenanced.\n  In Fitzgerald, plaintiff A.

The Court\nexplained that, \u201c[w]hen judicial action is needed to serve\nbroad public interests,\u2014as when the Court acts, not in dero-\ngation of the separation of powers, but to maintain their\nproper balance, or to vindicate the public interest in an ongo-\ning criminal prosecution\u2014the exercise of jurisdiction has\nbeen held warranted.\u201d Ibid. (citations omitted).\n   On the facts before it, the Court concluded that a \u201cmerely\nprivate suit for damages based on a President&#x27;s offcial acts\u201d\ndid not serve those interests. Ibid. The Court reasoned\nthat the \u201cvisibility of [the President&#x27;s] offce and the effect of\nhis actions on countless people\u201d made him an easy target for\ncivil suits that \u201cfrequently could distract [him] from his pub-\nlic duties.\u201d Id., at 753. The public interest in such private\ncivil suits, the Court concluded, was comparatively weak.\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nSee id., at 754, n. 37 (\u201c[T]here is a lesser public interest in\nactions for civil damages than, for example, in criminal\nprosecutions\u201d). Therefore, the Court held that a former\nPresident was immune from such suits. Ibid.\n   In the context of a federal criminal prosecution of a former\nPresident, however, the danger to the functioning of the Exec-\nutive Branch is much reduced. Further, as every member of\nthe Fitzgerald Court acknowledged, see Part IV\u2013B\u20132, infra,\nthe public interest in a criminal prosecution is far weightier.\nApplying the Fitzgerald balancing here should yield the oppo-\nsite result. Instead, the majority elides any difference be-\ntween civil and criminal immunity, granting Trump the same\nimmunity from criminal prosecution that Nixon enjoyed from\nan unlawful termination suit. That is plainly wrong.\n\n                                 1\n  The majority relies almost entirely on its view of the dan-\nger of intrusion on the Executive Branch, to the exclusion of\nthe other side of the balancing test. Its analysis rests on\n\f670                TRUMP v.

It also ignores the fact\nthat he receives robust legal advice on the lawfulness of his\nactions.\n   The majority says that the danger \u201cof intrusion on the\nauthority and functions of the Executive Branch\u201d posed by\ncriminally prosecuting a former President for offcial conduct\n\u201cis akin to, indeed greater than, what led us to recognize\nabsolute Presidential immunity from civil damages liabil-\nity\u2014that the President would be chilled from taking the\n`bold and unhesitating action&#x27; required of an independent Ex-\necutive.\u201d Ante, at 613 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U.

It is of course important that the President be able\nto \u201c ` \u201cdeal fearlessly and impartially with\u201d the duties of his\noffce.&#x27; \u201d Ante, at 611 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457 U.

Yet there are\nmany facets of criminal liability, which the majority dis-\ncounts, that make it less likely to chill Presidential action\nthan the threat of civil litigation.\n   First, in terms of probability, the threat of criminal liabil-\nity is much smaller. In Fitzgerald, the threat of vexatious\ncivil litigation loomed large. The Court observed that,\ngiven the \u201cvisibility of his offce and the effect of his actions\non countless people, the President would be an easily identi-\nfable target for suits for civil damages.\u201d Id., at 753. Al-\nthough \u201c `the effect of [the President&#x27;s] actions on countless\npeople&#x27; could result in untold numbers of private plaintiffs\nsuing for damages based on any number of Presidential acts\u201d\nin the civil context, the risk in the criminal context is \u201conly\nthat a former President may face one federal prosecution, in\none jurisdiction, for each criminal offense allegedly com-\nmitted while in offce.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">704 F.

The majority\noverlooks that paramount interest entirely.\n   Finally, the question of federal criminal immunity for a\nformer President \u201cinvolves a countervailing Article II con-\nsideration absent in Fitzgerald\u201d: recognizing such an immu-\nnity \u201cwould frustrate the Executive Branch&#x27;s enforcement of\nthe criminal law.\u201d Brief for United States 19.

It does not. Rather, it diminishes that independence,\nexalting occupants of the offce over the offce itself. There\nis a twisted irony in saying, as the majority does, that the\nperson charged with \u201ctak[ing] Care that the Laws be faith-\nfully executed\u201d can break them with impunity.\n   In the case before us, the public interest and countervail-\ning Article II interest are particularly stark. The public in-\nterest in this criminal prosecution implicates both \u201c[t]he Ex-\necutive Branch&#x27;s interest in upholding Presidential elections\nand vesting power in a new President under the Constitu-\ntion\u201d as well as \u201cthe voters&#x27; interest in democratically select-\n\f                   Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">603 U.

It also, of course, implicates Congress&#x27;s own\ninterest in regulating conduct through the criminal law. Cf.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.

Yet the ma-\njority believes that a President&#x27;s anxiety over prosecution\noverrides the public&#x27;s interest in accountability and negates\nthe interests of the other branches in carrying out their con-\nstitutionally assigned functions. It is, in fact, the majority&#x27;s\nposition that \u201cboil[s] down to ignoring the Constitution&#x27;s sep-\naration of powers.\u201d Ante, at 640.\n\n                                C\n   Finally, in an attempt to put some distance between its\noffcial-acts immunity and Trump&#x27;s requested immunity, the\nmajority insists that \u201cTrump asserts a far broader immunity\nthan the limited one [the majority has] recognized.\u201d Ante,\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nat 632. If anything, the opposite is true. The only part of\nTrump&#x27;s immunity argument that the majority rejects is the\nidea that \u201cthe Impeachment Judgment Clause requires that\nimpeachment and Senate conviction precede a President&#x27;s\ncriminal prosecution.\u201d Ibid. That argument is obviously\nwrong. See ante, at 632\u2013634. Rejecting it, however, does\nnot make the majority&#x27;s immunity narrower than Trump&#x27;s.\nInherent in Trump&#x27;s Impeachment Judgment Clause argu-\nment is the idea that a former President who was impeached\nin the House and convicted in the Senate for crimes involving\nhis offcial acts could then be prosecuted in court for those\nacts. See Brief for Petitioner 22 (\u201cThe Founders thus\nadopted a carefully balanced approach that permits the crim-\ninal prosecution of a former President for his offcial acts,\nbut only if that President is frst impeached by the House\nand convicted by the Senate\u201d). By extinguishing that path\nto overcoming immunity, however nonsensical it might be,\nthe majority arrives at an offcial-acts immunity even more\nexpansive than the one Trump argued for. On the majori-\n\f678                TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nty&#x27;s view (but not Trump&#x27;s), a former President whose abuse\nof power was so egregious and so offensive even to members\nof his own party that he was impeached in the House and\nconvicted in the Senate still would be entitled to \u201cat least\npresumptive\u201d criminal immunity for those acts.\n\n                                V\n   Separate from its offcial-acts immunity, the majority rec-\nognizes absolute immunity for \u201cconduct within [the Presi-\ndent&#x27;s] exclusive sphere of constitutional authority.\u201d Ante,\nat 609. Feel free to skip over those pages of the majority&#x27;s\nopinion. With broad offcial-acts immunity covering the\nfeld, this ostensibly narrower immunity serves little pur-\npose. In any event, this case simply does not turn on con-\nduct within the President&#x27;s \u201cexclusive sphere of constitu-\ntional authority,\u201d and the majority&#x27;s attempt to apply a core\nimmunity of its own making expands the concept of \u201ccore\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nconstitutional powers,\u201d ante, at 606, beyond any recogniz-\nable bounds.\n   The idea of a narrow core immunity might have some intu-\nitive appeal, in a case that actually presented the issue.

He was not charged, for ex-\nample, with illegally wielding the Presidency&#x27;s pardon power\nor veto power or appointment power or even removal power.\nInstead, Trump was charged with a conspiracy to commit\nfraud to subvert the Presidential election. It is true that\nthe detailed indictment in this case alleges that Trump\nthreatened to remove an Acting Attorney General who\nwould not carry out his scheme. See, e. g., App. 216\u2013217,\nIndictment \u00b6\u00b674, 77. Yet it is equally clear that the Govern-\nment does not seek to \u201cimpose criminal liability on the\n[P]resident for exercising or talking about exercising the ap-\npointment and removal power.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 127. If\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthat were the majority&#x27;s concern, it could simply have said\nthat the Government cannot charge a President&#x27;s threatened\nuse of the removal power as an overt act in the conspiracy.\nIt says much more.\n   The core immunity that the majority creates will insulate\na considerably larger sphere of conduct than the narrow core\nof \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d powers that the Court pre-\nviously has recognized. The frst indication comes when the\nmajority includes the President&#x27;s broad duty to \u201c `take Care\nthat the Laws be faithfully executed&#x27; \u201d among the core func-\ntions for which a former President supposedly enjoys abso-\nlute immunity. Ante, at 620 (quoting Art. II, \u00a7 3). That ex-\npansive view of core power will effectively insulate all sorts\nof noncore conduct from criminal prosecution. Were there\nany question, consider how the majority applies its newly\nminted core immunity to the allegations in this case. It con-\ncludes that \u201cTrump is . . . absolutely immune from prosecu-\ntion for\u201d any \u201cconduct involving his discussions with Justice\n\f680               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nDepartment offcials.\u201d Ante, at 621. That conception of\ncore immunity expands the \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d cate-\ngory beyond recognition, foreclosing the possibility of prose-\ncution for broad swaths of conduct. Under that view of core\npowers, even fabricating evidence and insisting the Depart-\nment use it in a criminal case could be covered. The majori-\nty&#x27;s conception of \u201ccore\u201d immunity sweeps far more broadly\nthan its logic, borrowed from Youngstown, should allow.\n   The majority tries to assuage any concerns about its made-\nup core immunity by suggesting that the Government agrees\nwith it. See ante, at 634. That suggestion will surprise the\nGovernment. To say, as the Government did, that a \u201csmall\ncore of exclusive offcial acts\u201d such as \u201cthe pardon power,\nthe power to recognize foreign nations, the power to veto\nlegislation, [and] the power to make appointments\u201d cannot\nbe regulated by Congress, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 85\u201387, does\nnot suggest that the Government agrees with immunizing\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nany and all conduct conceivably related to the majority&#x27;s\nbroad array of supposedly \u201ccore\u201d powers. The Government\nin fact advised this Court to \u201cleav[e] potentially more diff-\ncult questions\u201d about the scope of any immunity \u201cthat might\narise on different facts for decision if they are ever pre-\nsented.\u201d Brief for United States 45. That would have\nmade sense. The indictment here does not pose any threat\nof impermissibly criminalizing acts within the President&#x27;s\n\u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d authority. Perhaps for this rea-\nson, even Trump discouraged consideration of \u201ca narrower\nscope of immunity,\u201d claiming that such an immunity \u201cwould\nbe nearly impossible to fashion, and would certainly involve\nimpractical line-drawing problems in every application.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 43\u201344.\n   When forced to wade into thorny separation-of-powers dis-\nputes, this Court&#x27;s usual practice is to \u201cconfne the opinion\nonly to the very questions necessary to decision of the case.\u201d\nDames &amp; Moore v.

It says that acts for which the\nPresident is immune must be redacted from the narrative of\neven wholly private crimes committed while in offce. They\nmust play no role in proceedings regarding private criminal\nacts. See ante, at 630\u2013632.\n   Even though the majority&#x27;s immunity analysis purports to\nleave unoffcial acts open to prosecution, its draconian ap-\nproach to offcial-acts evidence deprives these prosecutions\nof any teeth. If the former President cannot be held crimi-\nnally liable for his offcial acts, those acts should still be ad-\nmissible to prove knowledge or intent in criminal prosecu-\ntions of unoffcial acts. For instance, the majority struggles\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nwith classifying whether a President&#x27;s speech is in his capac-\nity as President (offcial act) or as a candidate (unoffcial act).\nImagine a President states in an offcial speech that he in-\ntends to stop a political rival from passing legislation that he\nopposes, no matter what it takes to do so (offcial act). He\nthen hires a private hitman to murder that political rival\n(unoffcial act). Under the majority&#x27;s rule, the murder in-\ndictment could include no allegation of the President&#x27;s public\nadmission of premeditated intent to support the mens rea of\nmurder. That is a strange result, to say the least.5\n   The majority&#x27;s extraordinary rule has no basis in law.\nConsider the First Amendment context. Although the First\nAmendment prohibits criminalizing most speech, it \u201cdoes not\n  5\n    The majority suggests, in a footnote, that a \u201cprosecutor may point to\nthe public record to show the fact that the President performed the offcial\nact,\u201d so long as the prosecutor does not \u201cinvite the jury to inspect\u201d the\nact in any way.

The majority has no coherent explanation as to\nwhy these protections that are suffcient in every other con-\ntext would be insuffcient here. It simply asserts that it\nwould be \u201cuntenable\u201d and would deprive immunity of its\n\u201c `intended effect.&#x27; \u201d Ante, at 631 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457\nU. S., at 756). The majority hazards an explanation that the\nuse of offcial-acts evidence will \u201craise a unique risk that the\njurors&#x27; deliberations will be prejudiced by their views of the\nPresident&#x27;s policies and performance while in offce.\u201d Ante,\nat 631. That \u201cunique risk,\u201d however, is not a product of in-\ntroducing offcial-acts evidence. It is simply the risk in-\nvolved in any suit against a former President, including the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nprivate-acts prosecutions the majority says it would allow.\n\n                                  VII\n  Today&#x27;s decision to grant former Presidents immunity for\ntheir offcial acts is deeply wrong. As troubling as this\ncriminal immunity doctrine is in theory, the majority&#x27;s appli-\ncation of the doctrine to the indictment in this case is per-\nhaps even more troubling. In the hands of the majority, this\nnew offcial-acts immunity operates as a one-way ratchet.\n  First, the majority declares all of the conduct involving\nthe Justice Department and the Vice President to be offcial\nconduct, see ante, at 619\u2013625, yet it refuses to designate any\ncourse of conduct alleged in the indictment as private, de-\nspite concessions from Trump&#x27;s counsel.6 Trump&#x27;s counsel\n  6\n    The majority protests that it is \u201cadher[ing] to time-tested practices\u201d\nby \u201cdeciding what is required to dispose of this case and remanding\u201d to\nlower courts to sort out the details.

He likewise conceded that the allegation that\nTrump \u201cconspired with another private attorney who caused\nthe fling in court of a verifcation signed by [Trump] that\ncontained false allegations to support a challenge\u201d \u201csounds\nprivate.\u201d Ibid.; see also </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.,</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 36\u201337 (Trump&#x27;s counsel ex-\nplaining that it is not \u201cdisputed\u201d that such conduct is \u201cunof-\nfcial\u201d). Again, when asked about allegations that \u201c[t]hree\nprivate actors . . . helped implement a plan to submit fraudu-\nlent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certifca-\ntion proceeding, and [Trump] and a co-conspirator attorney\ndirected that effort,\u201d Trump&#x27;s counsel conceded the alleged\nconduct was \u201cprivate.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.,</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 29\u201330. Only the majority\nthinks that organizing fraudulent slates of electors might\nqualify as an offcial act of the President, see ante, at 625\u2013\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n628, or at least an act so \u201cinterrelated\u201d with other allegedly\noffcial acts that it might warrant protection, ante, at 628.\nIf the majority&#x27;s sweeping conception of \u201coffcial acts\u201d has\nany real limits, the majority is unwilling to reveal them in\ntoday&#x27;s decision.\n   Second, the majority designates certain conduct immune\nwhile refusing to recognize anything as prosecutable. It\nshields large swaths of conduct involving the Justice Depart-\nment with immunity, see ante, at 619\u2013621; see also Part V,\nsupra, but it does not give an inch in the other direction.\nThe majority admits that the Vice President&#x27;s responsibility\n\u201c `presiding over the Senate&#x27; \u201d is \u201c `not an \u201cexecutive branch\u201d\n\nany party briefed by designating certain conduct offcial in the frst in-\nstance. See ibid. (noting \u201cthe lack of factual analysis in the lower courts,\nand the lack of briefng on how to categorize the conduct alleged\u201d). In\nreaching out to shield some conduct as offcial while refusing to recognize\nany conduct as unoffcial, the majority engages in judicial activism, not\njudicial restraint.\n\f684               TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Sotomayor, J., dissenting\n\nfunction,&#x27; \u201d and it further admits that the President \u201cplays\nno direct constitutional or statutory role\u201d in the counting of\nelectoral votes. Ante, at 624. Yet the majority refuses to\nconclude that Trump lacks immunity for his alleged attempts\nto \u201cenlist the Vice President to use his ceremonial role at the\nJanuary 6 certifcation proceeding to fraudulently alter the\nelection results.\u201d App. 187, Indictment \u00b610(d). Instead, it\nworries that a prosecution for this conduct might make it\nharder for the President to use the Vice President \u201cto ad-\nvance [his] agenda in Congress.\u201d Ante, at 624. Such a\nprosecution, according to the majority, \u201cmay well hinder the\nPresident&#x27;s ability to perform his constitutional functions.\u201d\nIbid. Whether a prosecution for this conduct warrants im-\nmunity should have been an easy question, but the majority\nturns it into a debatable one. Remarkably, the majority\ngoes further and declines to deny immunity even for the alle-\ngations that Trump organized fraudulent elector slates, pres-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nsured States to subvert the legitimate election results,\nand exploited violence at the Capitol to infuence the certif-\ncation proceedings. It is not conceivable that a prosecu-\ntion for these alleged efforts to overturn a Presidential elec-\ntion, whether labeled offcial or unoffcial under the majori-\nty&#x27;s test, would pose any \u201c `dangers of intrusion on the\nauthority and functions of the Executive Branch,&#x27; \u201d ante, at\n615, and the majority could have said as much. Instead,\nit perseverates on a threshold question that should be\nimmaterial.\n   Looking beyond the fate of this particular prosecution, the\nlong-term consequences of today&#x27;s decision are stark. The\nCourt effectively creates a law-free zone around the Presi-\ndent, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the\nfounding. This new offcial-acts immunity now \u201clies about\nlike a loaded weapon\u201d for any President that wishes to place\nhis own interests, his own political survival, or his own f-\nnancial gain, above the interests of the Nation.

According to the majority, whether a\nformer President is immune depends on how his criminal\nconduct is classifed, as among three possible categories.\n   First, with respect to any criminal conduct relating to a\nPresident&#x27;s \u201ccore constitutional powers\u201d\u2014those subjects\n\u201cwithin his `conclusive and preclusive&#x27; constitutional author-\nity\u201d\u2014the President is entitled to absolute immunity from\ncriminal prosecution.

Second, ex-\npanding outward from this \u201ccore,\u201d regarding all other \u201cacts\nwithin the outer perimeter of [the President&#x27;s] offcial re-\nsponsibility,\u201d the President is entitled to \u201cat least a presump-\ntive immunity from criminal prosecution.\u201d Ante, at 614.\nThird, if the criminal conduct at issue comprises \u201cunoffcial\nacts, there is no immunity.\u201d Ante, at 615.3\n\nPage\n  2\n    Its feignedProof         Pending\n                judicial humility notwithstanding, Publication\n                                                   see ante, at 641, the ma-\njority&#x27;s holding goes further\u2014much further\u2014than necessary to resolve\nthis case. Petitioner&#x27;s argument in both the lower courts and this one\nwas that a former President is categorically immune from federal criminal\nprosecution for \u201call\u201d acts within the outer perimeter of his offcial duties.\nSee Opening Brief for Defendant-Appellant in No. 23\u20133228 (CADC, Dec.\n23, 2023), p. 9; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">91 F. 4th 1173</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1188\u20131189, 1195, 1208 (CADC 2024) (per cu-\nriam); Brief for Petitioner 41\u201347 (arguing for absolute immunity for \u201call\nactions within the `outer perimeter&#x27; \u201d of a President&#x27;s responsibilities, and\nimploring the Court not to adopt a \u201c `function-based&#x27; approach\u201d). Thus, it\nwould have been enough for the Court simply to reject petitioner&#x27;s cate-\ngorical claim and leave it at that. But the majority sua sponte rephrased\nthe question presented, and it now takes full advantage of this opportunity\nto devise from whole cloth an entirely new legal framework for judicial\nevaluation of potential criminal immunity for former Presidents.\n   3\n     It is important to note that the majority reframes the immunity question\npresented here as a separation of powers concern that is compelled by Arti-\ncle II\u2014as if what is being asked is whether Congress can criminalize execu-\ntive prerogatives. See, e. g., ante, at 606\u2013607; see also ante, at 650\u2013652\n(Barrett, J., concurring in part). But that is not anywhere close to what\nis happening in this case. No one maintains that Congress has passed a\nlaw that specifcally criminalizes the President&#x27;s use of any power that the\n\f692                  TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Jackson, J., dissenting\n\n   Applying the majority&#x27;s new Presidential accountability\nmodel thus seems to involve bearing down on the indict-\nment&#x27;s allegations and making a series of determinations\nabout the nature of the conduct at issue. From the struc-\nture of the paradigm, it appears that the frst decision point\nis whether the alleged criminal conduct involves one of the\nPresident&#x27;s \u201ccore\u201d powers. If so (and apparently regardless\nof the degree to which the conduct implicates that core\npower), the President is absolutely immune from criminal\nliability for engaging in that criminal conduct. If not, then\none must proceed to consider whether the conduct qualifes\nas an \u201coffcial\u201d act or \u201cunoffcial\u201d act of that President. If\nthe crime is an offcial act, the President is presumptively\nimmune from criminal prosecution and punishment. But\neven then, immunity still hinges on whether there is any\nlegal or factual basis for concluding that the presumption of\nimmunity has been rebutted. Alternatively, if the charged\nconduct is an unoffcial act (a determination that, inciden-\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ntally, courts must make without considering the President&#x27;s\nmotivations, ante, at 618), the President is not immune.4\n\nConstitution vests exclusively in the Executive, much less that the Judi-\nciary is being conscripted to adjudicate the propriety of such a statute.\nTo the contrary, the indictment here invokes criminal statutes of general\napplicability that everyone is supposed to follow, both on and off the job.\nSo, the real question is: Can the President, too, be held accountable for\ncommitting crimes while he is undertaking his offcial duties? The nature\nof his authority under Article II (whether conclusive and preclusive, or\nshared with Congress, or otherwise) is entirely beside the point.\n   4\n     Justice Barrett&#x27;s version of the Presidential accountability para-\ndigm works slightly differently; she would have us ask, frst, \u201cwhether\nthe relevant criminal statute reaches the President&#x27;s offcial conduct.\u201d\nAnte, at 652. But, again, what is at issue here are statutes of general\napplicability\u2014they only \u201creach\u201d the President&#x27;s conduct to the extent that\nhe chooses to engage in the prohibited behavior. See n. 3, supra. Jus-\ntice Barrett&#x27;s framing, thus, sidesteps the fact that, when immunity is\nbeing considered, what is actually at issue is whether the President is\nexempt from punishment if he opts to exercise his offcial duties using\nmeans that violate criminal law.\n\f                   Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">603 U.

For one thing, it makes it next to impossible to\nknow ex ante when and under what circumstances a Presi-\ndent will be subject to accountability for his criminal acts.\nFor every allegation, courts must run this gauntlet frst\u2014\nno matter how well documented or heinous the criminal act\nmight be.\n   Thus, even a hypothetical President who admits to having\nordered the assassinations of his political rivals or critics,\nsee, e. g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, or one who indisputably insti-\ngates an unsuccessful coup, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.,</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 41\u201343, has a fair shot at\ngetting immunity under the majority&#x27;s new Presidential ac-\ncountability model. That is because whether a President&#x27;s\nconduct will subject him to criminal liability turns on the\nPage Proof Pending Publication\ncourt&#x27;s evaluation of a variety of factors related to the char-\nacter of that particular act\u2014specifcally, those characteris-\ntics that imbue an act with the status of \u201coffcial\u201d or \u201cunoff-\ncial\u201d conduct (minus motive). In the end, then, under the\nmajority&#x27;s new paradigm, whether the President will be ex-\nempt from legal liability for murder, assault, theft, fraud, or\nany other reprehensible and outlawed criminal act will turn\non whether he committed that act in his offcial capacity, such\nthat the answer to the immunity question will always and\ninevitably be: It depends.\n   Under the individual accountability paradigm, the account-\nability analysis is markedly less convoluted, and leads to a\nmore certain outcome. None of the same complications or\nconsequences arise, because, as I have explained, there are\nno exemptions from the criminal law for any person, but\nevery defendant can assert whatever legal arguments and\ndefenses might be applicable under governing law. Since no\none is above the law, everyone can focus on what the law\ndemands and permits, and on what the defendant did or did\n\f694                   TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Jackson, J., dissenting\n\nnot do; no one has to worry about characterizing any criminal\nconduct as offcial or unoffcial in order to assess the applica-\nbility of an immunity at the outset.\n   The majority&#x27;s new Presidential accountability model is\nalso distinct insofar as it accepts as a basic starting premise\nthat generally applicable criminal laws do not apply to every-\none in our society. In the majority&#x27;s view, while all other\ncitizens of the United States must do their jobs and live their\nlives within the confnes of criminal prohibitions, the Presi-\ndent cannot be made to do so; he must sometimes be exempt\nfrom the law&#x27;s dictates depending on the character of his\nconduct. Indeed, the majority holds that the President, un-\nlike anyone else in our country, is comparatively free to\nengage in criminal acts in furtherance of his offcial duties.\n   That point bears emphasizing.

Before accountability can be sought or\nrendered, the Judiciary serves as a newfound special gate-\nkeeper, charged not merely with interpreting the law but\nwith policing whether it applies to the President at all.\nAlso, under the new Presidential accountability model, the\nstarting presumption is that the criminal law does not apply\nto Presidents, no matter how obviously illegal, harmful, or\nunacceptable a President&#x27;s offcial behavior might be. Re-\ngardless of all that, courts must now ensure that a former\nPresident is not held accountable for any criminal conduct\nhe engages in while he is on duty, unless his conduct consists\nprimarily (and perhaps solely) of unoffcial acts.\n\n                                3\n   The structure and function of the two accountability para-\ndigms are not the only differences\u2014the models also assign\ndifferent roles to participants in the criminal justice system,\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nand they ultimately generate different relationships between\nthe Presidency and the Rule of Law.\n   Under the individual accountability model, duty-bound\nprosecutorial offcers initially exercise their discretion to de-\ncide whether to seek punishment for alleged violations of\ncriminal law (a determination that is made based on numer-\nous factors). And even if prosecutors decide to bring a\ncharge, a jury of the criminal defendant&#x27;s peers ultimately\ndetermines whether that defendant (including a former Pres-\nident) will actually be held to account for having engaged\nin unlawful conduct, after the court has resolved any legal\nchallenges and has instructed the jury as to the require-\nments of the law.\n   By contrast, under the majority&#x27;s new Presidential ac-\ncountability paradigm, what a prosecutor or jury does may\nnot even matter, since the courts take center stage once\ncharges are brought against a former President, marshaling\ntheir resources to conduct a complex and amorphous thresh-\nold immunity evaluation.

This means that the President remains answer-\nable to the law, insofar as he must show that he was justifed\nin committing a criminal act while in offce under the given\ncircumstances. In other words, while the President might\nindeed be privileged to commit a crime in the course of his\noffcial duties, any such privilege exists only when the People\n(acting either through their elected representatives or as\nmembers of a jury) determine that the former President&#x27;s\nconduct was in fact justifed, notwithstanding the general\ncriminal prohibition.\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n   Under the majority&#x27;s immunity regime, by contrast, the\nPresident can commit crimes in the course of his job even\nunder circumstances in which no one thinks he has any ex-\ncuse; the law simply does not apply to him. Unlike a de-\nfendant who invokes an affrmative defense and relies on a\nlegal determination that there was a good reason for his oth-\nerwise unlawful conduct, a former President invoking immu-\nnity relies on the premise that he can do whatever he wants,\nhowever he wants, so long as he uses his \u201c `offcial power&#x27; \u201d\nin doing so.

But with the parameters of offcial and unoffcial\nconduct unknown, I think it highly unlikely that a sitting\nPresident would feel constrained by these remote\npossibilities.\n   All of this leads me to ponder why, exactly, has the major-\nity concluded that an indeterminate \u201ccore\u201d-versus-\u201coffcial\u201d-\nversus-\u201cunoffcial\u201d line-drawing exercise is the better way to\naddress potential criminal acts of a President? Could it be\nPage Proof Pending Publication\nthat the majority believes the obviously grave dangers of\nshifting from the individual accountability model to the Pres-\nidential accountability model might nevertheless be offset by\nthe great benefts of doing so?

I worry that, after today&#x27;s ruling,\nour Nation will reap what this Court has sown.\n   Stated simply: The Court has now declared for the frst\ntime in history that the most powerful offcial in the United\nStates can (under circumstances yet to be fully determined)\nbecome a law unto himself. As we enter this uncharted ter-\nritory, the People, in their wisdom, will need to remain ever\nattentive, consistently fulflling their established role in our\nconstitutional democracy, and thus collectively serving as the\nultimate safeguard against any chaos spawned by this\nCourt&#x27;s decision.

That core princi-\nple has long prevented our Nation from devolving into despo-\ntism. Yet the Court now opts to let down the guardrails of\nthe law for one extremely powerful category of citizen: any\nfuture President who has the will to fout Congress&#x27;s estab-\nlished boundaries.\n   In short, America has traditionally relied on the law to\nkeep its Presidents in line. Starting today, however, Ameri-\ncans must rely on the courts to determine when (if at all)\nthe criminal laws that their representatives have enacted to\npromote individual and collective security will operate as\nspeedbumps to Presidential action or reaction. Once self-\nregulating, the Rule of Law now becomes the rule of judges,\nwith courts pronouncing which crimes committed by a Presi-\ndent have to be let go and which can be redressed as imper-\n\f706              TRUMP v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Jackson, J., dissenting\n\nmissible. So, ultimately, this Court itself will decide\nwhether the law will be any barrier to whatever course of\ncriminality emanates from the Oval Offce in the future.\nThe potential for great harm to American institutions and\nAmericans themselves is obvious.\n                       *      *      *\n  The majority of my colleagues seems to have put their\ntrust in our Court&#x27;s ability to prevent Presidents from be-\ncoming Kings through case-by-case application of the inde-\nterminate standards of their new Presidential accountability\nparadigm. I fear that they are wrong. But, for all our\nsakes, I hope that they are right.\n  In the meantime, because the risks (and power) the Court\nhas now assumed are intolerable, unwarranted, and plainly\nantithetical to bedrock constitutional norms, I dissent.\n\n\nPage Proof Pending Publication\n\f                            Reporter\u2019s Note\n\n  The attached opinion has been revised to refect the usual publication\nand citation style of the United States Reports.
