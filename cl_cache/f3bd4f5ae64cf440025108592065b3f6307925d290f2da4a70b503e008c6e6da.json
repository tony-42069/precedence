CASA, INC., ET AL.\n\n                  ON APPLICATION FOR PARTIAL STAY\n\n      No. 24A884.       Argued May 15, 2025\u2014Decided June 27, 2025*\n\n\nPlaintiffs (respondents here)\u2014individuals, organizations, and States\u2014\n  filed three separate suits to enjoin the implementation and enforce-\n  ment of President Trump\u2019s Executive Order No. 14160. See Protecting\n  the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship, 90 Fed. Reg. 8449.\n  The Executive Order identifies circumstances in which a person born\n  in the United States is not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d and is\n  thus not recognized as an American citizen. The plaintiffs allege that\n  the Executive Order violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship\n  Clause, \u00a71, and \u00a7201 of the Nationality Act of 1940. In each case, the\n  District Court entered a \u201cuniversal injunction\u201d\u2014an injunction barring\n  executive officials from applying the Executive Order to anyone, not\n  just the plaintiffs. And in each case, the Court of Appeals denied the\n  Government\u2019s request to stay the sweeping relief. The Government\n  argues that the District Courts lacked equitable authority to impose\n  universal relief and has filed three nearly identical emergency appli-\n  cations seeking partial stays to limit the preliminary injunctions to the\n  plaintiffs in each case. The applications do not raise\u2014and thus the\n  Court does not address\u2014the question whether the Executive Order vi-\n  olates the Citizenship Clause or Nationality Act. Instead, the issue\n  the Court decides is whether, under the Judiciary Act of 1789, federal\n  courts have equitable authority to issue universal injunctions.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   *Together with No. 24A885, Trump, President of the United States,\net al. v.

CASA, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\nHeld: Universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that\n Congress has given to federal courts. The Court grants the Govern-\n ment\u2019s applications for a partial stay of the injunctions entered below,\n but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary\n to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue. Pp. 4\u2013\n 26.\n    (a) The issue raised by these applications\u2014whether Congress has\n granted federal courts authority to universally enjoin the enforcement\n of an executive order\u2014plainly warrants this Court\u2019s review. On mul-\n tiple occasions, and across administrations, the Solicitor General has\n asked the Court to consider the propriety of this expansive remedy. As\n the number of universal injunctions has increased over the years, so\n too has the importance of the issue. Pp. 4\u20135.\n    (b) The Government is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim\n that the District Courts lacked authority to issue universal injunc-\n tions. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434 (holding that for a stay\n application to be granted, the applicant must make a strong showing\n of likelihood of success on the merits). The issuance of a universal in-\n junction can be justified only as an exercise of equitable authority, yet\n Congress has granted federal courts no such power. The Judiciary Act\n of 1789 endowed federal courts with jurisdiction over \u201call suits . . . in\n equity,\u201d \u00a711, 1 Stat. 78, and still today, this statute \u201cis what authorizes\n the federal courts to issue equitable remedies,\u201d S. Bray & E. Sherwin,\n Remedies 442. This Court has held that the statutory grant encom-\n passes only those sorts of equitable remedies \u201ctraditionally accorded\n by courts of equity\u201d at our country\u2019s inception. Grupo Mexicano de De-\n sarrollo, S. A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U. S. 308, 319.\n    Universal injunctions are not sufficiently \u201canalogous\u201d to any relief\n available in the court of equity in England at the time of the founding.\n Grupo Mexicano, 527 U. S., at 318\u2013319. Equity offered a mechanism\n for the Crown \u201cto secure justice where it would not be secured by the\n ordinary and existing processes of law.\u201d G. Adams, The Origin of Eng-\n lish Equity, 16 Colum. L. Rev. 87, 91. This \u201cjudicial prerogative of the\n King\u201d thus extended to \u201cthose causes which the ordinary judges were\n incapable of determining.\u201d 1 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence \u00a731,\n p. 27. Eventually, the Crown instituted the \u201cpractice of delegating the\n cases\u201d that \u201ccame before\u201d the judicial prerogative \u201cto the chancellor for\n his sole decision.\u201d Id., \u00a734, at 28. The \u201cgeneral rule in Equity [was]\n that all persons materially interested [in the suit] [were] to be made\n parties to it.\u201d J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Pleadings \u00a772, p. 74\n (Story). Injunctions were no exception; there were \u201csometimes suits to\n restrain the actions of particular officers against particular plaintiffs.\u201d\n S. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131\n Harv. L. Rev. 417, 425 (Bray, Multiple Chancellors). Of importance\n\f                    Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nhere, suits in equity were brought by and against individual parties,\nand the Chancellor\u2019s remedies were generally party specific. See Ive-\nson v. Harris, 7 Ves. 251, 257, 32 Eng. Rep. 102, 104 (\u201c[Y]ou cannot\nhave an injunction except against a party to the suit\u201d). In sum, under\nlongstanding equity practice in England, there was no remedy \u201cre-\nmotely like a national injunction.\u201d Bray, Multiple Chancellors 425.\n   Nor did founding-era courts of equity in the United States chart a\ndifferent course. If anything, the approach traditionally taken by fed-\neral courts cuts against the existence of such a sweeping remedy. Con-\nsider Scott v. Donald, where the plaintiff successfully challenged the\nconstitutionality of a law on which state officials had relied to confis-\ncate alcohol that the plaintiff kept for personal use. See 165 U. S. 107,\n109 (statement of case); id., at 111\u2013112 (opinion of the Court). Alt-\nhough the plaintiff sought an injunction barring enforcement of the\nlaw against both himself and anyone \u201cwhose rights [were] infringed\nand threatened\u201d by it, the Court permitted only relief benefitting the\nnamed plaintiff. Id., at 115\u2013117. In the ensuing decades, the Court\nconsistently rebuffed requests for relief that extended beyond the par-\nties. See, e.g., Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U. S. 113, 123; Froth-\ningham v. Mellon, decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S.\n447, 487\u2013489.\n   The Court\u2019s early refusals to grant relief to nonparties are consistent\nwith the party-specific principles that permeate the Court\u2019s under-\nstanding of equity. \u201c[N]either declaratory nor injunctive relief,\u201d the\nCourt has said, \u201ccan directly interfere with enforcement of contested\nstatutes or ordinances except with respect to the particular federal\nplaintiffs.\u201d Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S. 922, 931. In fact, uni-\nversal injunctions were conspicuously nonexistent for most of the Na-\ntion\u2019s history. Their absence from 18th and 19th century equity prac-\ntice settles the question of judicial authority.\n   While \u201cequity is flexible,\u201d Grupo Mexicano, 527 U. S., at 322, the\nCourt\u2019s precedent emphasizes that its \u201cflexibility is confined within the\nbroad boundaries of traditional equitable relief.\u201d Ibid. Because the\nuniversal injunction lacks a historical pedigree, it falls outside the\nbounds of a federal court\u2019s equitable authority under the Judiciary Act.\nPp. 5\u201311.\n   (c) Respondents\u2019 counterarguments are unavailing. Pp. 11\u201321.\n      (1) In an effort to satisfy Grupo Mexicano\u2019s historical test, re-\nspondents claim that universal injunctions are the modern equivalent\nof the decree resulting from a \u201cbill of peace\u201d\u2014a form of group litigation\nin the Court of Chancery. Respondents contend that the existence of\nthis historic equitable device means that federal courts have the equi-\ntable authority to issue universal injunctions under the Judiciary Act.\nThe analogy, however, does not work. True, \u201cbills of peace allowed\n\f4                          TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    [courts of equity] to adjudicate the rights of members of dispersed\n    groups without formally joining them to a lawsuit through the usual\n    procedures.\u201d Arizona v. Biden, 40 F. 4th 375, 397 (Sutton, C. J., con-\n    curring). Unlike universal injunctions, however, which reach anyone\n    affected by executive or legislative action, bills of peace involved a\n    \u201cgroup [that] was small and cohesive.\u201d Bray, Multiple Chancellors\n    426. And unlike universal injunctions, which bind only the parties to\n    the suit, decrees resulting from a bill of peace \u201cwould bind all members\n    of the group, whether they were present in the action or not.\u201d 7A C.\n    Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71751,\n    at 10.\n       The bill of peace lives in modern form, but not as the universal in-\n    junction. It is instead analogous to the modern class action\u2014which, in\n    federal court, is governed by Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\n    cedure. See ibid. Rule 23 requires numerosity (such that joinder is\n    impracticable), common questions of law or fact, typicality, and repre-\n    sentative parties who adequately protect the interests of the class.\n    Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(a). The requirements for a bill of peace were\n    virtually identical. See 7A Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure\n    \u00a71751, at 10 and n. 4. By forging a shortcut to relief that benefits par-\n    ties and nonparties alike, universal injunctions impermissibly circum-\n    vent Rule 23\u2019s procedural protections. Pp. 12\u201315.\n          (2) Respondents contend that universal injunctions\u2014or at least\n    these universal injunctions\u2014are simply an application of the principle\n    that a court of equity may fashion a remedy that awards complete re-\n    lief. But \u201ccomplete relief\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cuniversal relief.\u201d\n    It is a narrower concept, long embraced in the equitable tradition, that\n    allows courts to \u201cadminister complete relief between the parties.\u201d Kin-\n    ney-Coastal Oil Co. v. Kieffer, 277 U. S. 488, 507 (emphasis added). To\n    be sure, party-specific injunctions sometimes \u201cadvantag[e] nonpar-\n    ties,\u201d Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S 667, 717 (THOMAS, J., concurring),\n    but they do so only incidentally.\n       Here, prohibiting enforcement of the Executive Order against the\n    child of an individual pregnant plaintiff will give that plaintiff com-\n    plete relief: Her child will not be denied citizenship. And extending\n    the injunction to cover everyone similarly situated would not render\n    her relief any more complete. So the individual and associational re-\n    spondents are wrong to characterize the universal injunction as simply\n    an application of the complete-relief principle. The inquiry is more\n    complicated for the state respondents, because the relevant injunction\n    does not purport to directly benefit nonparties. Instead, the District\n    Court for the District of Massachusetts decided that a universal in-\n    junction was necessary to provide the States themselves complete re-\n\f                    Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)                       5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nlief. As the States see it, their harms\u2014financial injuries and the ad-\nministrative burdens flowing from citizen-dependent benefits pro-\ngrams\u2014cannot be remedied without a blanket ban on the enforcement\nof the Executive Order. Children often move across state lines or are\nborn outside their parents\u2019 State of residence. Given the cross-border\nflow, the States say, a \u201cpatchwork injunction\u201d would prove unworkable\nfor the provision of certain federally funded benefits. The Government\nretorts that even if the injunction is designed to benefit only the States,\nit is \u201cmore burdensome than necessary to redress\u201d their asserted\nharms, see Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 702, and that nar-\nrower relief is appropriate. The Court declines to take up these argu-\nments in the first instance. The lower courts should determine\nwhether a narrower injunction is appropriate, so we leave it to them\nto consider these and any related arguments. Pp. 15\u201319.\n      (3) Respondents defend universal injunctions as a matter of pol-\nicy; the Government advances policy arguments running the other\nway. As with most questions of law, the policy pros and cons are beside\nthe point. Under the Court\u2019s well-established precedent, see Grupo\nMexicano, 527 U. S., at 319, because universal injunctions lack a\nfounding-era forebear, federal courts lack authority to issue them. Pp.\n19\u201321.\n   (d) To obtain interim relief, the Government must show that it is\nlikely to suffer irreparable harm absent a stay. Nken, 556 U. S., at\n434\u2013435. When a federal court enters a universal injunction against\nthe Government, it \u201cimproper[ly] intru[des]\u201d on \u201ca coordinate branch\nof the Government\u201d and prevents the Government from enforcing its\npolicies against nonparties. INS v. Legalization Assistance Project of\nLos Angeles County Federation of Labor, 510 U. S. 1301, 1306 (O\u2019Con-\nnor, J., in chambers); see also Maryland v. King, 567 U. S. 1301, 1303\n(ROBERTS, C. J., in chambers) (\u201c \u2018[A]ny time a State is enjoined by a\ncourt from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its peo-\nple, it suffers a form of irreparable injury\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original)).\nThe Court\u2019s practice also demonstrates that an applicant need not\nshow it will prevail on the underlying merits when it seeks a stay on a\nthreshold issue. See, e.g., Gutierrez v. Saenz, 603 U. S. ___; OPM v.\nAFGE, 604 U. S. ___. The Government here is likely to suffer irrepa-\nrable harm from the District Courts\u2019 entry of injunctions that likely\nexceed the authority conferred by the Judiciary Act. And the balance\nof equities does not counsel against awarding the Government interim\nrelief: A partial stay will cause no harm to respondents because they\nwill remain protected by the preliminary injunctions to the extent nec-\nessary and appropriate to afford them complete relief. Pp. 24\u201326.\n   (e) When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted un-\nlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too. The\n\f6                         TRUMP v.

The injunctions before\nus today reflect a more recent development: district courts\nasserting the power to prohibit enforcement of a law or pol-\nicy against anyone. These injunctions\u2014known as \u201cuniver-\nsal injunctions\u201d\u2014likely exceed the equitable authority that\n\f2                        TRUMP v.

See 763 F. Supp. 3d 723 (Md. 2025),\nappeal pending, No. 25\u20131153 (CA4); 765 F. Supp. 3d 1142\n(WD Wash. 2025), appeal pending, No. 25\u2013807 (CA9); Doe\nv. Trump, 766 F.

The plaintiffs\u2014individuals, organ-\nizations, and States\u2014sought to enjoin the implementation\nand enforcement of President Trump\u2019s Executive Order No.\n14160.2 See Protecting the Meaning and Value of American\nCitizenship, 90 Fed. Reg. 8449 (2025). The Executive Order\nidentifies circumstances in which a person born in the\nUnited States is not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof \u201d and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Such injunctions are sometimes called \u201cnationwide injunctions,\u201d re-\n\nflecting their use by a single district court to bar the enforcement of a\nlaw anywhere in the Nation. But the term \u201cuniversal\u201d better captures\nhow these injunctions work. Even a traditional, parties-only injunction\ncan apply beyond the jurisdiction of the issuing court. Steele v. Bulova\nWatch Co., 344 U. S. 280, 289 (1952) (When \u201cexercising its equity pow-\ners,\u201d a district court \u201cmay command persons properly before it to cease\nor perform acts outside its territorial jurisdiction\u201d). The difference be-\ntween a traditional injunction and a universal injunction is not so much\nwhere it applies, but whom it protects: A universal injunction prohibits\nthe Government from enforcing the law against anyone, anywhere.

But it argues that the States lack third-\nparty standing because their claims rest exclusively on the rights of in-\ndividuals.

See ibid.\nSpecifically, it sets forth the \u201cpolicy of the United States\u201d to\nno longer issue or accept documentation of citizenship in\ntwo scenarios: \u201c(1) when [a] person\u2019s mother was unlawfully\npresent in the United States and the person\u2019s father was\nnot a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at\nthe time of said person\u2019s birth, or (2) when [a] person\u2019s\nmother\u2019s presence in the United States was lawful but tem-\nporary, and the person\u2019s father was not a United States cit-\nizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said per-\nson\u2019s birth.\u201d Ibid. The Executive Order also provides for a\n30-day ramp-up period. During that time, the order directs\nexecutive agencies to develop and issue public guidance re-\ngarding the order\u2019s implementation. See id., at 8449\u20138450.\n   The plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that the Executive Order\nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause,\n\u00a71, as well as \u00a7201 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat.\n1138 (codified at 8 U. S. C. \u00a71401). In each case, the District\nCourt concluded that the Executive Order is likely unlawful\nand entered a universal preliminary injunction barring var-\nious executive officials from applying the policy to anyone\nin the country. And in each case, the Court of Appeals de-\nnied the Government\u2019s request to stay the sweeping relief.\nSee 2025 WL 654902 (CA4, Feb. 28, 2025); 2025 WL 553485\n(CA9, Feb. 19, 2025); 131 F. 4th 27 (CA1 2025).\n   The Government has now filed three nearly identical ap-\nplications seeking to partially stay the universal prelimi-\nnary injunctions and limit them to the parties. See Appli-\ncation for Partial Stay of Injunction in No. 24A884;\nApplication for Partial Stay of Injunction in No. 24A885;\nApplication for Partial Stay of Injunction in No. 24A886.3\nThe applications do not raise\u2014and thus we do not ad-\ndress\u2014the question whether the Executive Order violates\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Because the applications are materially identical, we cite only the ap-\n\nplication in No. 24A884 throughout the rest of the opinion.\n\f4                     TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Citizenship Clause or Nationality Act. The issue before\nus is one of remedy: whether, under the Judiciary Act of\n1789, federal courts have equitable authority to issue uni-\nversal injunctions.\n                                II\n   The question whether Congress has granted federal\ncourts the authority to universally enjoin the enforcement\nof an executive or legislative policy plainly warrants our re-\nview, as Members of this Court have repeatedly empha-\nsized. See, e.g., McHenry v. Texas Top Cop Shop, 604 U. S.\n___, ___ (2025) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in grant of stay)\n(slip op., at 1) (\u201cI would . . . take this case now to resolve\ndefinitively the question whether a district court may issue\nuniversal injunctive relief \u201d); Labrador v. Poe, 601 U. S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2024) (GORSUCH, J., joined by THOMAS and ALITO,\nJJ., concurring in grant of stay) (slip op., at 7\u20138) (\u201c[T]he pro-\npriety of universal injunctive relief [is] a question of great\nsignificance that has been in need of the Court\u2019s attention\nfor some time\u201d); Griffin v. HM Florida-ORL, LLC, 601 U.

Hawaii, 585 U. S. 667, 713 (2018)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (\u201cIf [universal injunctions\u2019] popu-\nlarity continues, this Court must address their legality\u201d).\nOn multiple occasions, and across administrations, the So-\nlicitor General has asked us to consider the propriety of this\nexpansive remedy.

T. 2017, No. 17\u2013965 (first Trump ad-\nministration).\n   It is easy to see why. By the end of the Biden administra-\ntion, we had reached \u201ca state of affairs where almost every\n\f                    Cite as: 606 U.

Congressional Re-\nsearch Service, J. Lampe, Nationwide Injunctions in the\nFirst Hundred Days of the Second Trump Administration 1\n(May 16, 2025). As the number of universal injunctions has\nincreased, so too has the importance of the issue.\n                                 III\n                                  A\n  The Government is likely to succeed on the merits of its\nargument regarding the scope of relief. See Nken v. Holder,\n556 U. S. 418, 434 (2009) (holding that for a stay application\nto be granted, the applicant must make \u201c \u2018a strong showing\nthat [it] is likely to succeed on the merits\u2019 \u201d). A universal\ninjunction can be justified only as an exercise of equitable\nauthority, yet Congress has granted federal courts no such\npower.4\n  The Judiciary Act of 1789 endowed federal courts with\njurisdiction over \u201call suits . . . in equity,\u201d \u00a711, 1 Stat. 78, and\nstill today, this statute \u201cis what authorizes the federal\ncourts to issue equitable remedies,\u201d S. Bray & E. Sherwin,\nRemedies 442 (4th ed. 2024). Though flexible, this equita-\nble authority is not freewheeling. We have held that the\nstatutory grant encompasses only those sorts of equitable\nremedies \u201ctraditionally accorded by courts of equity\u201d at our\ncountry\u2019s inception. Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. v.\nAlliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U. S. 308, 319 (1999); see\nalso, e.g., Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, 430 (1869) (\u201cThe eq-\nuity jurisdiction conferred on the Federal courts is the same\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Our decision rests solely on the statutory authority that federal\n\ncourts possess under the Judiciary Act of 1789.

S., at 318\u2013319 (quoting\nA. Dobie, Handbook of Federal Jurisdiction and Procedure\n660 (1928)).\n   The answer is no: Neither the universal injunction nor\nany analogous form of relief was available in the High\nCourt of Chancery in England at the time of the founding.\nEquity offered a mechanism for the Crown \u201cto secure justice\nwhere it would not be secured by the ordinary and existing\nprocesses of law.\u201d G. Adams, The Origin of English Equity,\n16 Colum. L. Rev. 87, 91 (1916). This \u201cjudicial prerogative\nof the King\u201d thus extended to \u201cthose causes which the ordi-\nnary judges were incapable of determining.\u201d 1 J. Pomeroy,\nEquity Jurisprudence \u00a731, p. 27 (1881). Eventually, the\nCrown instituted the \u201cpractice of delegating the cases\u201d that\n\u201ccame before\u201d the judicial prerogative \u201cto the chancellor for\nhis sole decision.\u201d Id., \u00a734, at 28. This \u201cbecame the common\nmode of dealing with such controversies.\u201d Ibid.\n   Of importance here, suits in equity were brought by and\nagainst individual parties. Indeed, the \u201cgeneral rule in Eq-\nuity [was] that all persons materially interested [in the\nsuit] [were] to be made parties to it.\u201d J.

And in cer-\ntain cases, the \u201cAttorney General could be a defendant.\u201d\nIbid. The Chancellor\u2019s remedies were also typically party\nspecific. \u201cAs a general rule, an injunction\u201d could not bind\none who was not a \u201cparty to the cause.\u201d F. Calvert, Suits in\nEquity 120 (2d ed. 1847); see also Iveson v. Harris, 7 Ves.\n251, 257, 32 Eng. Rep. 102, 104 (1802) (\u201c[Y]ou cannot have\nan injunction except against a party to the suit\u201d). Suffice it\nto say, then, under longstanding equity practice in Eng-\nland, there was no remedy \u201cremotely like a national injunc-\ntion.\u201d Bray, Multiple Chancellors 425.\n   Nor did founding-era courts of equity in the United States\nchart a different course. See 1 Pomeroy, Equity Jurispru-\ndence \u00a741, at 33\u201334. If anything, the approach traditionally\ntaken by federal courts cuts against the existence of such a\nsweeping remedy. Consider Scott v. Donald, where the\nplaintiff successfully challenged the constitutionality of a\nlaw on which state officials had relied to confiscate alcohol\nthat the plaintiff kept for personal use. See 165 U. S. 107,\n109 (1897) (statement of case); id., at 111\u2013112 (opinion of\nthe Court). Although the plaintiff sought an injunction bar-\nring enforcement of the law against both himself and any-\none else \u201cwhose rights [were] infringed and threatened\u201d by\nit, this Court permitted only a narrower decree between\n\u201cthe parties named as plaintiff and defendants in the bill.\u201d\nId., at 115\u2013117.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Though the principal dissent claims otherwise, we do not treat Scott\n\nas \u201cdispositive.\u201d Post, at 28 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). Under Grupo\nMexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U. S. 308\n(1999), the lack of a historical analogue is dispositive. Scott simply illus-\ntrates that as late as 1897, this Court adhered to a party-specific view of\nrelief. And while the principal dissent relies on Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S.\n466, 518 (1898), as a counterexample to Scott, see post, at 28 (opinion of\n\f8                        TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In the ensuing decades, we consistently rebuffed requests\nfor relief that extended beyond the parties. See, e.g., Per-\nkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U. S. 113, 123 (1940) (\u201cThe\nbenefits of [the court\u2019s] injunction\u201d improperly extended \u201cto\nbidders throughout the Nation who were not parties to any\nproceeding, who were not before the court[,] and who had\nsought no relief \u201d); cf. Frothingham v. Mellon, decided with\nMassachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 487\u2013489 (1923)\n(concluding that the Court lacked authority to issue \u201cpre-\nventive relief \u201d that would apply to people who \u201csuffe[r] in\nsome indefinite way in common with people generally\u201d);\nBray, Multiple Chancellors 433 (explaining that the Froth-\ningham analysis \u201cintertwines concepts of equity, remedies,\nand the judicial power\u201d). As Justice Nelson put it while rid-\ning circuit, \u201c[t]here is scarcely a suit at law, or in equity, . . .\nin which a general statute is interpreted, that does not in-\nvolve a question in which other parties are interested.\u201d Cut-\nting v.

But to allow all persons subject to the statute to be\ntreated as parties to a lawsuit \u201cwould confound the estab-\nlished order of judicial proceedings.\u201d Ibid.\n   Our early refusals to grant relief to nonparties are con-\nsistent with the party-specific principles that permeate our\nunderstanding of equity. \u201c[N]either declaratory nor injunc-\ntive relief,\u201d we have said, \u201ccan directly interfere with en-\nforcement of contested statutes or ordinances except with\nrespect to the particular federal plaintiffs.\u201d Doran v.

See Bray, Multiple Chancellors\n439\u2013443 (referencing Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 (1968),\nand Harlem Valley Transp. Assn. v. Stafford, 360 F. Supp.\n1057 (SDNY 1973)).

Ibid.\n   The bottom line? The universal injunction was conspicu-\nously nonexistent for most of our Nation\u2019s history. Its ab-\nsence from 18th- and 19th-century equity practice settles\nthe question of judicial authority.8 See Grupo Mexicano,\n527 U. S., at 318\u2013319. That the absence continued into the\n20th century renders any claim of historical pedigree still\nmore implausible. Even during the \u201cdeluge of constitu-\ntional litigation that occurred in the wake of Ex parte\nYoung, throughout the Lochner Era, and at the dawn of the\nNew Deal,\u201d universal injunctions were nowhere to be found.\nM. Morley, Disaggregating the History of Nationwide In-\njunctions: A Response to Professor Sohoni, 72 Ala. L. Rev.\n239, 252 (2020) (footnotes omitted). Had federal courts be-\nlieved themselves to possess the tool, surely they would not\nhave let it lay idle.\n   Faced with this timeline, the principal dissent accuses us\nof \u201cmisunderstand[ing] the nature of equity\u201d as being\n\u201cfr[ozen] in amber . . . at the time of the Judiciary Act.\u201d\nPost, at 29 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). Not so. We said it\nbefore, see supra, at 5, and say it again: \u201c[E]quity is flexi-\nble.\u201d Grupo Mexicano, 527 U. S., at 322.

See post, at 29 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,\nJ.). But this absence only bolsters our case. That this Court had no oc-\ncasion to reject the universal injunction as inconsistent with traditional\nequity practice merely demonstrates that no party even bothered to ask\nfor such a sweeping remedy\u2014because no court would have entertained\nthe request. Cf. Grupo Mexicano, 527 U.

A modern device need\nnot have an exact historical match, but under Grupo Mexi-\ncano, it must have a founding-era antecedent. And neither\nthe universal injunction nor a sufficiently comparable pre-\ndecessor was available from a court of equity at the time of\nour country\u2019s inception. See id., at 333. Because the uni-\nversal injunction lacks a historical pedigree, it falls outside\nthe bounds of a federal court\u2019s equitable authority under\nthe Judiciary Act.10 See id., at 318\u2013319.\n                              B\n  Respondents raise several counterarguments, which the\nprincipal dissent echoes. First, they insist that the univer-\nsal injunction has a sufficient historical analogue: a decree\nresulting from a bill of peace. Second, they maintain that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Notwithstanding Grupo Mexicano, the principal dissent invokes Ex\n\nparte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), as support for the proposition that\nequity can encompass remedies that have \u201cno analogue in the relief ex-\nercised in the English Court of Chancery,\u201d because Ex parte Young per-\nmits plaintiffs to \u201cobtain plaintiff-protective injunctions against Govern-\nment officials,\u201d and the English Court of Chancery \u201ccould not enjoin the\nCrown or English officers,\u201d post, at 30 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But\ncontrary to the principal dissent\u2019s suggestion, Ex parte Young does not\nsay\u2014either explicitly or implicitly\u2014that courts may devise novel reme-\ndies that have no background in traditional equitable practice. Histori-\ncally, a court of equity could issue an antisuit injunction to prevent an\nofficer from engaging in tortious conduct. Ex parte Young justifies its\nholding by reference to a long line of cases authorizing suits against state\nofficials in certain circumstances. See 209 U. S., at 150\u2013152 (citing, e.g.,\nOsborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824); Governor of Geor-\ngia v. Madrazo, 1 Pet. 110 (1828); and Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203\n(1873)). Support for the principal dissent\u2019s approach is found not in\nEx parte Young, but in Justice Ginsburg\u2019s partial dissent in Grupo Mex-\nicano, which eschews the governing historical approach in favor of \u201c[a]\ndynamic equity jurisprudence.\u201d 527 U.

This bill allowed the Chan-\ncellor to consolidate multiple suits that involved a \u201ccommon\nclaim the plaintiff could have against multiple defendants\u201d\nor \u201csome kind of common claim that multiple plaintiffs\ncould have against a single defendant.\u201d Bray, Multiple\nChancellors 426; see How v.

Universal in-\njunctions are analogous to this traditional equitable device,\nrespondents say, so federal courts have authority under the\nJudiciary Act to issue them.\n  The analogy does not work. True, \u201cbills of peace allowed\n[courts of equity] to adjudicate the rights of members of dis-\npersed groups without formally joining them to a lawsuit\nthrough the usual procedures.\u201d Arizona v.

And unlike uni-\nversal injunctions, which bind only the parties to the suit,\ndecrees obtained on a bill of peace \u201cwould bind all members\nof the group, whether they were present in the action or\nnot.\u201d 7A Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71751, at\n10; see Smith v. Swormstedt, 16 How. 288, 303 (1854)\n(When \u201ca court of equity permits a portion of the parties in\ninterest to represent the entire body . . . the decree binds all\nof them the same as if all were before the court\u201d); see also\nStory \u00a7120 (\u201c[I]n most, if not in all, cases of this sort, the\ndecree obtained upon such a Bill will ordinarily be held\nbinding upon all other persons standing in the same predic-\nament\u201d). As Chief Judge Sutton aptly put it, \u201c[t]he domes-\nticated animal known as a bill of peace looks nothing like\nthe dragon of nationwide injunctions.\u201d Arizona, 40 F. 4th,\nat 397 (concurring opinion).\n   The bill of peace lives in modern form, but not as the uni-\nversal injunction. It evolved into the modern class action,\nwhich is governed in federal court by Rule 23 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure. 7A Wright, Federal Practice and\nProcedure \u00a71751, at 10 (\u201cIt was the English bill of peace\nthat developed into what is now known as the class action\u201d);\nsee Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U. S. 32, 41 (1940) (\u201cThe class suit\nwas an invention of equity\u201d). And while Rule 23 is in some\nways \u201cmore restrictive of representative suits than the orig-\ninal bills of peace,\u201d Rodgers v. Bryant, 942 F. 3d 451, 464\n(CA8 2019) (Stras, J., concurring), it would still be recog-\nnizable to an English Chancellor.

None of these requirements is a pre-\nrequisite for a universal injunction.\n    Rule 23\u2019s limits on class actions underscore a significant\nproblem with universal injunctions. A \u201c \u2018properly conducted\nclass action,\u2019 \u201d we have said, \u201ccan come about in federal\ncourts in just one way\u2014through the procedure set out in\nRule 23.\u201d Smith v.

Yet by forging a shortcut to relief that\nbenefits parties and nonparties alike, universal injunctions\ncircumvent Rule 23\u2019s procedural protections and allow\n\u201c \u2018courts to \u201ccreate de facto class actions at will.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Smith,\n564 U. S., at 315 (quoting Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U. S. 880,\n901 (2008)). Why bother with a Rule 23 class action when\nthe quick fix of a universal injunction is on the table? Cf.\nGrupo Mexicano, 527 U. S., at 330\u2013331 (\u201cWhy go through\nthe trouble of complying with local attachment and garnish-\nment statutes when this all-purpose prejudgment injunc-\ntion is available?\u201d). The principal dissent\u2019s suggestion that\nthese suits could have satisfied Rule 23\u2019s requirements\nsimply proves that universal injunctions are a class-action\nworkaround. Post, at 25\u201326 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.).\n    The taxpayer suit is a similarly inadequate historical\nanalogy. Contra, post, at 24\u201325.

But the practice of extending\nrelief \u201cwith respect to any taxpayer\u201d was not adopted by\nstate courts until the mid-19th century, and even then, not\nall states were willing to provide such sweeping relief. See\nBray, Multiple Chancellors 427. This post-founding prac-\ntice of some state courts thus sheds minimal light on federal\ncourts\u2019 equitable authority under the Judiciary Act. What\nis more, in Frothingham, we refused to allow a single tax-\npayer to challenge a federal appropriations act. 262 U. S.,\nat 486\u2013487. That counsels against placing much, if any, re-\nliance on taxpayer suits as justification for the modern uni-\nversal injunction.\n                              2\n  Respondents contend that universal injunctions\u2014or at\nleast these universal injunctions\u2014are consistent with the\nprinciple that a court of equity may fashion a remedy that\nawards complete relief. See Opposition to Application in\nNo. 24A884 (CASA), at 22\u201325; Opposition to Application in\nNo. 24A885 (Washington), pp. 28\u201332; Opposition to Appli-\ncation in No. 24A886 (New Jersey), pp. 31\u201339. We agree\nthat the complete-relief principle has deep roots in equity.\nBut to the extent respondents argue that it justifies the\naward of relief to nonparties, they are mistaken.11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 JUSTICE JACKSON, for her part, thinks the \u201cpremise\u201d that universal\n\ninjunctions provide relief to nonparties is \u201csuspect\u201d because, in her view,\n\u201c[n]onparties may benefit from an injunction, but only the plaintiff gets\nrelief.\u201d Post, at 8\u20139, n. 2 (dissenting opinion). The availability of con-\ntempt proceedings suggests otherwise. Consider the civil contempt con-\ntext. Under \u201ctraditional principles of equity practice,\u201d courts may \u201cim-\npos[e] civil contempt sanctions to \u2018coerce [a] defendant into compliance\u2019\nwith an injunction.\u201d Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U. S. 554, 560 (2019)\n(quoting United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 303\u2013304 (1947)).\nGenerally, civil contempt proceedings occur between the original parties\nto the lawsuit. See Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418,\n\f16                       TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   \u201cComplete relief \u201d is not synonymous with \u201cuniversal re-\nlief.\u201d It is a narrower concept: The equitable tradition has\nlong embraced the rule that courts generally \u201cmay admin-\nister complete relief between the parties.\u201d Kinney-Coastal\nOil Co. v. Kieffer, 277 U. S. 488, 507 (1928) (emphasis\nadded). While party-specific injunctions sometimes \u201cad-\nvantag[e] nonparties,\u201d Trump, 585 U. S., at 717 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring), they do so only incidentally.\n   Consider an archetypal case: a nuisance in which one\nneighbor sues another for blasting loud music at all hours\nof the night. To afford the plaintiff complete relief, the court\nhas only one feasible option: order the defendant to turn her\nmusic down\u2014or better yet, off. That order will necessarily\nbenefit the defendant\u2019s surrounding neighbors too; there is\nno way \u201cto peel off just the portion of the nuisance that\nharmed the plaintiff.\u201d Rodgers, 942 F. 3d, at 462 (Stras, J.,\nconcurring); see A. Woolhandler & C. Nelson, Does History\nDefeat Standing Doctrine? 102 Mich. L. Rev. 689, 702\n(2004). But while the court\u2019s injunction might have the\npractical effect of benefiting nonparties, \u201cthat benefit [is]\nmerely incidental.\u201d Trump, 585 U. S., at 717 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring); see also 3 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence\n\u00a71349, pp. 380\u2013381 (1883).12 As a matter of law, the injunc-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n444\u2013445 (1911). But a federal court\u2019s \u201cpower in civil contempt proceed-\nings is determined by the requirements of full remedial relief \u201d to \u201ceffect\ncompliance with its decree.\u201d McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336\nU. S. 187, 193\u2013194 (1949). And \u201c[w]hen an order grants relief for a non-\nparty,\u201d as is the case with universal injunctions,\u201cthe procedure for en-\nforcing the order is the same as for a party.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 71; see,\ne.g., Zamecnik v. Indiana Prairie School Dist. No. 204, 636 F. 3d 874, 879\n(CA7 2011). So a nonparty covered by a universal injunction is likely to\nreap both the practical benefit and the formal relief of the injunction.\nSee M. Smith, Only Where Justified: Toward Limits and Explanatory\nRequirements for Nationwide Injunctions, 95 Notre Dame L. Rev. 2013,\n2019 (2020).\n   12 There may be other injuries for which it is all but impossible for\n\f                     Cite as: 606 U.

If the nuisance persists, and another neighbor wants\nto shut it down, she must file her own suit.13\n   The individual and associational respondents are there-\nfore wrong to characterize the universal injunction as\nsimply an application of the complete-relief principle. Un-\nder this principle, the question is not whether an injunction\noffers complete relief to everyone potentially affected by an\nallegedly unlawful act; it is whether an injunction will offer\ncomplete relief to the plaintiffs before the court. See Cali-\nfano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 702 (1979) (\u201c[I]njunctive\nrelief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than\nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs\u201d (em-\nphasis added)). Here, prohibiting enforcement of the Exec-\nutive Order against the child of an individual pregnant\nplaintiff will give that plaintiff complete relief: Her child\nwill not be denied citizenship. Extending the injunction to\ncover all other similarly situated individuals would not ren-\nder her relief any more complete.\n   The complete-relief inquiry is more complicated for the\nstate respondents, because the relevant injunction does not\npurport to directly benefit nonparties. Instead, the District\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts decided that a uni-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncourts to craft relief that is complete and benefits only the named plain-\ntiffs. See, e.g., Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899 (1996) (racially gerryman-\ndered congressional maps).\n   13 The new plaintiff might be able to assert nonmutual offensive issue\n\npreclusion. See Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U. S. 322, 331\u2013332\n(1979) (setting forth prerequisites for applying the doctrine). But non-\nmutual offensive issue preclusion is unavailable against the United\nStates. United States v. Mendoza, 464 U. S. 154, 155 (1984). That uni-\nversal injunctions end-run this rule is one of the Government\u2019s objections\nto them.\n\f18                      TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nversal injunction was necessary to provide the States them-\nselves with complete relief. See 766 F. Supp. 3d, at 288.14\nThe States maintain that the District Court made the right\ncall. See Opposition to Application in No. 24A886 (New Jer-\nsey), at 31\u201339.\n   As the States see it, their harms\u2014financial injuries and\nthe administrative burdens flowing from citizen-dependent\nbenefits programs\u2014cannot be remedied without a blanket\nban on the enforcement of the Executive Order. See, e.g.,\nid., at 9\u201311. Children often move across state lines or are\nborn outside their parents\u2019 State of residence. Id., at 31, 35.\nGiven the cross-border flow, the States say, a \u201cpatchwork\ninjunction\u201d would prove unworkable, because it would re-\nquire them to track and verify the immigration status of the\nparents of every child, along with the birth State of every\nchild for whom they provide certain federally funded bene-\nfits. Ibid.\n   The Government\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014sees matters differ-\nently. It retorts that even if the injunction is designed to\nbenefit only the States, it is \u201cmore burdensome than neces-\nsary to redress\u201d their asserted harms. Califano, 442 U. S.,\nat 702. After all, to say that a court can award complete\nrelief is not to say that it should do so. Complete relief is\nnot a guarantee\u2014it is the maximum a court can provide.\nAnd in equity, \u201cthe broader and deeper the remedy the\nplaintiff wants, the stronger the plaintiff \u2019s story needs to\nbe.\u201d S. Bray & P. Miller, Getting into Equity, 97 Notre\nDame L. Rev. 1763, 1797 (2022). In short, \u201c[t]he essence of\nequity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to\ndo equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the\nparticular case.\u201d Hecht Co. v.

For instance, the Dis-\ntrict Court could forbid the Government to apply the Exec-\nutive Order within the respondent States, including to chil-\ndren born elsewhere but living in those States. Application\nin No. 24A884, at 23. Or, the Government says, the District\nCourt could direct the Government to \u201ctreat covered chil-\ndren as eligible for purposes of federally funded welfare\nbenefits.\u201d Ibid. It asks us to stay the injunction insofar as\nit sweeps too broadly.\n   We decline to take up these arguments in the first in-\nstance. The lower courts should determine whether a nar-\nrower injunction is appropriate; we therefore leave it to\nthem to consider these and any related arguments.\n                               3\n   Respondents also defend universal injunctions as a mat-\nter of policy. They argue that a universal injunction is\nsometimes the only practical way to quickly protect groups\nfrom unlawful government action. See Opposition to Appli-\ncation in No. 24A884 (CASA), at 26\u201327; see also A. Frost,\nIn Defense of Nationwide Injunctions, 93 N. Y. U. L. Rev.\n1065, 1090\u20131094 (2018) (suggesting that universal injunc-\ntions are appropriate when not all interested individuals\ncan come quickly to court); post, at 37\u201339 (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\ndissenting). Respondents also contend that universal in-\njunctions are an appropriate remedy to preserve equal\ntreatment among individuals when the Executive Branch\nadopts a facially unlawful policy. Opposition to Application\nin No. 24A884 (CASA), at 25\u201327; cf. post, at 22\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). And they suggest that forcing\nplaintiffs to proceed on an individual basis can result in con-\nfusion or piecemeal litigation that imposes unnecessary\ncosts on courts and others. See Opposition to Application\nin No. 24A885 (Washington), at 31\u201332; Frost, 93 N. Y. U.\n\f20                        TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nL. Rev., at 1098\u20131101; see also post, at 31 (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\ndissenting). So, they insist, universal injunctions must be\npermitted for the good of the system.\n   The Government advances policy arguments running the\nother way. Echoing Chief Judge Sutton, the Government\nasserts that avoiding a patchwork enforcement system is a\njustification that \u201clacks a limiting principle and would\nmake nationwide injunctions the rule rather than the ex-\nception\u201d for challenges to many kinds of federal law. Ari-\nzona, 40 F. 4th, at 397 (concurring opinion). It stresses\u2014as\nthe principal dissent also observes\u2014that universal injunc-\ntions incentivize forum shopping, since a successful chal-\nlenge in one jurisdiction entails relief nationwide. See Ap-\nplication in No. 24A884, at 19\u201320; see also post, at 22\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). In a similar vein, the Govern-\nment observes that universal injunctions operate asymmet-\nrically: A plaintiff must win just one suit to secure sweeping\nrelief. But to fend off such an injunction, the Government\nmust win everywhere. See Application in No. 24A884,\nat 19\u201320; see also post, at 22\u201323 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.)\n(acknowledging this concern).15 Moreover, the Government\ncontends, the practice of universal injunctions means that\nhighly consequential cases are often decided in a \u201cfast\nand furious\u201d process of \u201c \u2018rushed, high-stakes, [and] low-\ninformation\u2019 \u201d decisionmaking. Labrador, 601 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 12) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in grant of stay).\nWhen a district court issues a universal injunction, thereby\nhalting the enforcement of federal policy, the Government\nsays that it has little recourse but to proceed to the court of\nappeals for an emergency stay. The loser in the court of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 The Government contrasts this with class actions. A judgment in a\n\nRule 23 class action (favorable or not) binds the whole class\u2014so if the\ndefendant wins, it is protected from future suits. But because an adverse\nruling on a request for universal relief lacks this preclusive effect, plain-\ntiffs can continue to file in different forums until they find a court willing\nto award such relief.\n\f                      Cite as: 606 U.

This process forces courts to re-\nsolve significant and difficult questions of law on a highly\nexpedited basis and without full briefing. See ibid.16\n   The upshot: As with most disputed issues, there are ar-\nguments on both sides. But as with most questions of law,\nthe policy pros and cons are beside the point. Under our\nwell-established precedent, the equitable relief available in\nthe federal courts is that \u201ctraditionally accorded by courts\nof equity\u201d at the time of our founding. Grupo Mexicano, 527\nU. S., at 319. Nothing like a universal injunction was avail-\nable at the founding, or for that matter, for more than a\ncentury thereafter. Thus, under the Judiciary Act, federal\ncourts lack authority to issue them.\n                              C\n  The principal dissent focuses on conventional legal ter-\nrain, like the Judiciary Act of 1789 and our cases on equity.\nJUSTICE JACKSON, however, chooses a startling line of at-\ntack that is tethered neither to these sources nor, frankly,\nto any doctrine whatsoever. Waving away attention to the\nlimits on judicial power as a \u201cmind-numbingly technical\nquery,\u201d post, at 3 (dissenting opinion), she offers a vision of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 Acknowledging these problems, the principal dissent admits that\n\n\u201c[t]here may be good reasons not to issue universal injunctions in the\ntypical case.\u201d Post, at 23 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). This concession,\nwhile welcome, is inconsistent with the position that the universal in-\njunction is a \u201cnothing to see here\u201d extension of the kind of decree obtained\non a bill of peace. Neither the principal dissent nor respondents have\npointed to any evidence that such decrees presented any of the universal\ninjunction\u2019s systemic problems or that they were reserved for situations\nin which the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cpatently unconstitutional\u201d and\nrisked \u201cexceptional\u201d harm. Post, at 22\u201323. It is precisely because the\nuniversal injunction is a new, potent remedy that it poses new, potent\nrisks.

CASA, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe judicial role that would make even the most ardent de-\nfender of judicial supremacy blush. In her telling, the fun-\ndamental role of courts is to \u201corder everyone (including the\nExecutive) to follow the law\u2014full stop.\u201d Post, at 2; see also\npost, at 10 (\u201c[T]he function of the courts\u2014both in theory and\nin practice\u2014necessarily includes announcing what the law\nrequires in . . . suits for the benefit of all who are protected\nby the Constitution, not merely doling out relief to injured\nprivate parties\u201d); see also post, at 11, n. 3, 15. And, she\nwarns, if courts lack the power to \u201crequire the Executive to\nadhere to law universally,\u201d post, at 15, courts will leave a\n\u201cgash in the basic tenets of our founding charter that could\nturn out to be a mortal wound,\u201d post, at 12.\n   Rhetoric aside, JUSTICE JACKSON\u2019s position is difficult to\npin down. She might be arguing that universal injunctions\nare appropriate\u2014even required\u2014whenever the defendant\nis part of the Executive Branch. See, e.g., post, at 3, 10\u201312,\n16\u201318. If so, her position goes far beyond the mainstream\ndefense of universal injunctions. See, e.g., Frost, 93\nN. Y. U. L. Rev., at 1069 (\u201cNationwide injunctions come\nwith significant costs and should never be the default rem-\nedy in cases challenging federal executive action\u201d). As best\nwe can tell, though, her argument is more extreme still, be-\ncause its logic does not depend on the entry of a universal\ninjunction: JUSTICE JACKSON appears to believe that the\nreasoning behind any court order demands \u201cuniversal ad-\nherence,\u201d at least where the Executive is concerned. Post,\nat 2 (dissenting opinion). In her law-declaring vision of the\njudicial function, a district court\u2019s opinion is not just per-\nsuasive, but has the legal force of a judgment. But see Haa-\nland v. Brackeen, 599 U. S. 255, 294 (2023) (\u201cIt is a federal\ncourt\u2019s judgment, not its opinion, that remedies an injury\u201d).\nOnce a single district court deems executive conduct unlaw-\nful, it has stated what the law requires.

We observe only this:\nJUSTICE JACKSON decries an imperial Executive while em-\nbracing an imperial Judiciary.\n   No one disputes that the Executive has a duty to follow\nthe law. But the Judiciary does not have unbridled author-\nity to enforce this obligation\u2014in fact, sometimes the law\nprohibits the Judiciary from doing so. See, e.g., Marbury v.\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803) (concluding that James Mad-\nison had violated the law but holding that the Court lacked\njurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus ordering him to\nfollow it). But see post, at 15 (JACKSON, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf\ncourts do not have the authority to require the Executive to\nadhere to law universally, . . . compliance with law some-\ntimes becomes a matter of Executive prerogative\u201d). Observ-\ning the limits on judicial authority\u2014including, as relevant\nhere, the boundaries of the Judiciary Act of 1789\u2014is re-\nquired by a judge\u2019s oath to follow the law.\n   JUSTICE JACKSON skips over that part. Because analyz-\ning the governing statute involves boring \u201clegalese,\u201d post, at\n3, she seeks to answer \u201ca far more basic question of enor-\nmous practical significance: May a federal court in the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 Think about what this position means. If a judge in the District of\n\nAlaska holds that a criminal statute is unconstitutional, can the United\nStates prosecute a defendant under that statute in the District of Mary-\nland? Perhaps JUSTICE JACKSON would instinctively say yes; it is hard to\nimagine anyone saying no. But why, on JUSTICE JACKSON\u2019s logic, does it\nnot violate the rule of law for the Executive to initiate a prosecution else-\nwhere? See post, at 2 (dissenting opinion). Among its many problems,\nJUSTICE JACKSON\u2019s view is at odds with our system of divided judicial au-\nthority. See, e.g., this Court\u2019s Rule 10(a) (identifying conflict in the deci-\nsions of the courts of appeals as grounds for granting certiorari). It is\nalso in considerable tension with the reality that district court opinions\nlack precedential force even vis-\u00e0-vis other judges in the same judicial\ndistrict. See Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. 692, 709, n. 7 (2011).\n\f24                        TRUMP v.

In other words, it is unnecessary to consider\nwhether Congress has constrained the Judiciary; what mat-\nters is how the Judiciary may constrain the Executive.\nJUSTICE JACKSON would do well to heed her own admoni-\ntion: \u201c[E]veryone, from the President on down, is bound by\nlaw.\u201d Ibid. That goes for judges too.\n                               IV\n   Finally, the Government must show a likelihood that it\nwill suffer irreparable harm absent a stay. Nken, 556 U. S.,\nat 434\u2013435. When a federal court enters a universal injunc-\ntion against the Government, it \u201cimproper[ly] intru[des]\u201d on\n\u201ca coordinate branch of the Government\u201d and prevents the\nGovernment from enforcing its policies against nonparties.\nINS v. Legalization Assistance Project of Los Angeles\nCounty Federation of Labor, 510 U. S. 1301, 1306 (1993)\n(O\u2019Connor, J., in chambers). That is enough to justify in-\nterim relief.\n   The principal dissent disagrees, insisting that \u201cit strains\ncredulity to treat the Executive Branch as irreparably\nharmed\u201d by these injunctions, even if they are overly broad.\nPost, at 17 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.); see also Opposition\nto Application in No. 24A884 (CASA), at 16\u201320.

Thus, \u201cthe Executive Branch has no\nright to enforce [it] against anyone.\u201d Post, at 15.\n   The principal dissent\u2019s analysis of the Executive Order is\npremature because the birthright citizenship issue is not\nbefore us.18 And because the birthright citizenship issue is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 The dissent worries that the Citizenship Clause challenge will never\n\nreach this Court, because if the plaintiffs continue to prevail, they will\nhave no reason to petition for certiorari. And if the Government keeps\nlosing, it will \u201cha[ve] no incentive to file a petition here . . . because the\noutcome of such an appeal would be preordained.\u201d Post, at 42 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.).

The dissent is wrong to say, however, that\na stay applicant cannot demonstrate irreparable harm from\na threshold error without also showing that, at the end of\nthe day, it will prevail on the underlying merits. That is\nnot how the Nken factors work. See 556 U. S., at 434. For\ninstance, when we are asked to stay an execution on the\ngrounds of a serious legal question, we ask whether the cap-\nital defendant is likely to prevail on the merits of the issue\nbefore us, not whether he is likely to prevail on the merits\nof the underlying suit. See, e.g., Gutierrez v. Saenz, 603\nU. S. ___ (2024) (granting application for a stay based on a\nquestion implicating the prisoner\u2019s standing to attempt to\naccess DNA testing). The same is true when an applicant\nseeks a stay in other contexts. See, e.g., OPM v. AFGE, 604\nU. S. ___ (2025) (granting application for stay because the\norganizational plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were \u201cinsufficient to\nsupport [their] standing\u201d). So too here.\n   The question before us is whether the Government is\nlikely to suffer irreparable harm from the District Courts\u2019\nentry of injunctions that likely exceed the authority con-\nferred by the Judiciary Act. The answer to that question is\nyes. See Coleman v. Paccar Inc., 424 U. S. 1301, 1307\u20131308\n(1976) (Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers); Trump v. Interna-\ntional Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.

I agree and join in full. As\nthe Court explains, the Judiciary Act of 1789\u2014the statute\nthat \u201c \u2018authorizes the federal courts to issue equitable rem-\nedies\u2019 \u201d\u2014does not permit universal injunctions. Ante, at 5.\nIt authorizes only those remedies traditionally available in\nequity, and there is no historical tradition allowing courts\nto provide \u201crelief that extend[s] beyond the parties.\u201d Ante,\nat 5\u201311. That conclusion is dispositive: As I have previously\nexplained, \u201c[i]f district courts have any authority to issue\n\f2                    TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nuniversal injunctions,\u201d it must come from some specific\nstatutory or constitutional grant. Trump v. Hawaii, 585\nU. S. 667, 713\u2013714 (2018) (concurring opinion). But, the\nJudiciary Act is the only real possibility, and serious consti-\ntutional questions would arise even if Congress purported\nto one day allow universal injunctions. See id., at 714, n. 2;\nsee also United States v. Texas, 599 U. S. 670, 693\u2013694\n(2023) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in judgment).\n   I write separately to emphasize the majority\u2019s guidance\nregarding how courts should tailor remedies specific to the\nparties. Courts must not distort \u201cthe rule that injunctive\nrelief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than\nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.\u201d Cali-\nfano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 702 (1979). Otherwise,\nthey risk replicating the problems of universal injunctions\nunder the guise of granting complete relief.\n   As the Court recognizes, the complete-relief principle op-\nerates as a ceiling: In no circumstance can a court award\nrelief beyond that necessary to redress the plaintiffs\u2019 inju-\nries. See ante, at 18 (\u201cComplete relief is not a guarantee\u2014\nit is the maximum a court can provide\u201d). This limitation\nfollows from both Article III and traditional equitable prac-\ntice. Because Article III limits courts to resolving specific\n\u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies,\u201d see U. S. Const., Art. III, \u00a72, it\nrequires that any remedy \u201cbe tailored to redress the plain-\ntiff \u2019s particular injury.\u201d Gill v. Whitford, 585 U. S. 48, 73\n(2018). And, equitable remedies historically operated on a\nplaintiff-specific basis. Ante, at 6\u20139. Accordingly, any\n\u201cremedy must of course be limited to the inadequacy that\nproduced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has estab-\nlished.\u201d Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 357 (1996).\n   Courts therefore err insofar as they treat complete relief\nas a mandate. Some judges have read our precedents to\nsuggest that courts should provide plaintiffs whatever rem-\nedy is necessary to give them complete relief. See, e.g.,\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U.

Garland, 75 F. 4th 563, 587 (CA5 2023) (\u201c[I]njunc-\ntions should be crafted to \u2018provide complete relief to the\nplaintiffs\u2019 \u201d); Z. Siddique, Nationwide Injunctions, 117\nColum. L. Rev. 2095, 2106 (2017) (\u201c[C]ourts . . . tailor their\ninjunctions to provide complete relief to the parties\u2014no less\nand no more\u201d). But, that reading misunderstands the com-\nplete-relief principle.\n   This principle reflects the equitable \u201crule that courts gen-\nerally \u2018may administer complete relief between the par-\nties.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 16 (emphasis deleted). It is an important\n\u201caim of the law of remedies . . . to put the plaintiff in her\nrightful position.\u201d S. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reform-\ning the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 466\n(2017) (Bray). But, \u201cto say that a court can award complete\nrelief is not to say that it should do so.\u201d Ante, at 18. And,\nin some circumstances, a court cannot award complete re-\nlief.\n   As the Court today affirms, any relief must fall within\ntraditional limits on a court\u2019s equitable powers. See ante,\nat 5\u20136 (citing Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. v. Alli-\nance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U. S. 308, 319 (1999); Payne v.\nHook, 7 Wall. 425, 430 (1869)). Courts must ask whether\nthe relief plaintiffs seek \u201cwas traditionally accorded by\ncourts of equity.\u201d Grupo Mexicano, 527 U. S., at 319. And,\nthey must ensure that any injunctions comport with both\nthe complete-relief principle and other \u201cprinciples of eq-\nuity.\u201d Ante, at 26. For example, courts may need to weigh\nconsiderations such as equity\u2019s concern \u201cwith justice . . .\nalso for the defendant.\u201d Bray 468; see H. McClintock,\nHandbook of the Principles of Equity 78 (2d ed. 1948). In\nsome cases, traditional equitable limits will require courts\nand plaintiffs to make do with less than complete relief.\n   This Court\u2019s decision in Frothingham v. Mellon, decided\nwith Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447 (1923), exem-\nplifies this constraint. Appellant Frothingham sought to\n\u201cenjoin the execution of a federal appropriation act\u201d on the\n\f4                        TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                         THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ngrounds that the Act exceeded the Government\u2019s authority\nand that its execution would improperly increase her tax\nburden. Id., at 479, 486. On a maximalist view of the com-\nplete-relief principle, Frothingham would have been enti-\ntled to a national injunction had her claim been meritori-\nous. After all, \u201ca prohibition on using her tax money for the\n[statute] would have been wholly ineffectual\u201d in remedying\nthe injury caused by unlawful federal spending, given \u201cthe\nfungibility of money\u201d: The Government would still have\nbeen free to execute the statute, so long as it labeled the\nunderlying funds as coming from other taxpayers. Bray\n431. A court thus would have needed to enjoin all spending\nunder the statute to provide effective relief. But, this Court\nrejected Frothingham\u2019s request for such an injunction as\nbeyond \u201cthe preventive powers of a court of equity.\u201d 262\nU. S., at 487. Among other reasons, it emphasized that an\nindividual taxpayer\u2019s \u201cinterest in the moneys of the Treas-\nury\u201d was \u201ccomparatively minute and indeterminable,\u201d and\nthat the petitioner had not suffered any \u201cdirect injury\u201d but\nrather was \u201csuffer[ing] in some indefinite way in common\nwith people generally.\u201d Id., at 487\u2013488.*\n   To be sure, \u201c[w]hat counts as complete relief \u201d can be a\ndifficult question. Bray 467. Many plaintiffs argue that\nonly sweeping relief can redress their injuries. And, I do\nnot dispute that there will be cases requiring an \u201cindivisible\nremedy\u201d that incidentally benefits third parties, Tr. of Oral\nArg., 14\u201315, such as \u201c[i]njunctions barring public nui-\nsances,\u201d Hawaii, 585 U. S., at 717 (THOMAS, J., concurring).\nBut, such cases are by far the exception.\n   An indivisible remedy is appropriate only when it would\nbe \u201call but impossible\u201d to devise relief that reaches only the\nplaintiffs. Ante, at 16\u201317, n. 12. Such impossibility is a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  *Although courts now treat Frothingham primarily as a case about\ntaxpayer standing, its analysis in fact \u201cintertwine[d] concepts of equity,\nremedies, and the judicial power.\u201d Bray 430\u2013433; see ante, at 8.\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U.

For example, the Court today readily dispatches\nwith the individual and associational respondents\u2019 position\nthat they require a universal injunction, notwithstanding\ntheir argument that a \u201cplaintiff-specific injunction\u201d would\nbe difficult to administer and would subject the associa-\ntions\u2019 members to the burden of having \u201cto identify and dis-\nclose to the government\u201d their membership.

The Court also makes clear that the complete-\nrelief principle provides a ceiling on federal courts\u2019 author-\nity, which must be applied alongside other \u201cprinciples of eq-\nuity\u201d and our holding that universal injunctions are imper-\nmissible. Ante, at 26. Lower courts should carefully heed\nthis Court\u2019s guidance and cabin their grants of injunctive\nrelief in light of historical equitable limits.

See ante, at 2, n. 2; see also ante, at 26 (\u201cThe Gov-\nernment\u2019s applications to partially stay the preliminary\n\f2                   TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\ninjunctions are granted, but only to the extent that the in-\njunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete\nrelief to each plaintiff with standing to sue\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Ordinarily, \u201ca litigant must assert his or her own\nlegal rights and interests, and cannot rest a claim to relief\non the legal rights or interests of third parties.\u201d Powers v.\nOhio, 499 U. S. 400, 410 (1991). In limited circumstances,\nhowever, the Court has permitted a party to assert the\nrights of a third party. Admittedly, the Court has not\npinned down the precise circumstances in which third-\nparty standing is permissible. See Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v.\nStatic Control Components, Inc., 572 U. S. 118, 127, n. 3\n(2014). And commentators have emphasized the need for\n\u201cgreater doctrinal coherence.\u201d C. Bradley & E. Young, Un-\npacking Third-Party Standing, 131 Yale L. J. 1, 7 (2021)\n(Bradley & Young).\n   But at a minimum, we have said that a litigant seeking\nto assert the legal rights or interests of others must demon-\nstrate ordinary Article III standing for itself and answer\nthe additional \u201cthreshold question whether [it has] stand-\ning to raise the rights of others.\u201d Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543\nU. S. 125, 129 (2004). But see FDA v. Alliance for Hippo-\ncratic Medicine, 602 U. S. 367, 398 (2024) (THOMAS, J., con-\ncurring). This latter requirement, as we have explained,\nentails a showing that the litigant has a \u201cclose relationship\u201d\nto the right holder and that there is some \u201c \u2018hindrance\u2019 \u201d to\nthe right holder\u2019s ability to \u201cprotect his own interests.\u201d\nKowalski, 543 U. S., at 130 (quoting Powers, 499 U. S., at\n411). So long as third-party standing doctrine remains good\nlaw, federal courts should take care to apply these limita-\ntions conscientiously, including against state plaintiffs.\nThat is especially so in cases such as these, in which the\nparties claiming third-party standing (i.e., the States) are\nnot directly subject to the challenged policy in the relevant\nrespect and face, at most, collateral injuries. See Bradley\n& Young 56\u201360.\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)             3\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\n   Today\u2019s decision only underscores the need for rigorous\nand evenhanded enforcement of third-party-standing limi-\ntations. The Court holds today that injunctive relief should\ngenerally extend only to the suing plaintiff. See ante, at 16\u2013\n17. That will have the salutary effect of bringing an end to\nthe practice of runaway \u201cuniversal\u201d injunctions, but it\nleaves other questions unanswered. Perhaps most im-\nportant, when a State brings a suit to vindicate the rights\nof individual residents and then procures injunctive relief,\ndoes the injunction bind the defendant with respect to all\nresidents of that State? If so, States will have every incen-\ntive to bring third-party suits on behalf of their residents to\nobtain a broader scope of equitable relief than any individ-\nual resident could procure in his own suit. Left unchecked,\nthe practice of reflexive state third-party standing will un-\ndermine today\u2019s decision as a practical matter.\n   Second, today\u2019s decision will have very little value if dis-\ntrict courts award relief to broadly defined classes without\nfollowing \u201cRule 23\u2019s procedural protections\u201d for class certi-\nfication. Ante, at 14. The class action is a powerful tool,\nand we have accordingly held that class \u201ccertification is\nproper only if the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous\nanalysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been sat-\nisfied.\u201d Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. 338, 350\u2013\n351 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). These re-\nquirements are more than \u201ca mere pleading standard,\u201d id.,\nat 350, and a hasty application of Rule 23 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure can have drastic consequences, cre-\nating \u201cpotential unfairness\u201d for absent class members and\nconfusion (and pressure to settle) for defendants. General\nTelephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 161\n(1982). Recognizing these effects, Congress took the excep-\ntional step of authorizing interlocutory review of class cer-\ntification. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(f ).\n   Putting the kibosh on universal injunctions does nothing\nto disrupt Rule 23\u2019s requirements. Of course, Rule 23 may\n\f4                   TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\npermit the certification of nationwide classes in some dis-\ncrete scenarios. But district courts should not view today\u2019s\ndecision as an invitation to certify nationwide classes with-\nout scrupulous adherence to the rigors of Rule 23. Other-\nwise, the universal injunction will return from the grave\nunder the guise of \u201cnationwide class relief,\u201d and today\u2019s de-\ncision will be of little more than minor academic interest.\n                        *    *    *\n   Lax enforcement of the requirements for third-party\nstanding and class certification would create a potentially\nsignificant loophole to today\u2019s decision. Federal courts\nshould thus be vigilant against such potential abuses of\nthese tools. I do not understand the Court\u2019s decision to re-\nflect any disagreement with these concerns, so I join its de-\ncision in full.\n\f                 Cite as: 606 U.

The District Courts granted\nuniversal preliminary injunctions\u2014that is, injunctions\nprohibiting enforcement of the Executive Order against\nanyone. Under the Court\u2019s holding today, district courts\nissuing injunctions under the authority afforded by the\nJudiciary Act of 1789 may award only plaintiff-specific\nrelief. I join the Court\u2019s careful and persuasive opinion,\nwhich will bring needed clarity to the law of remedies.\n  To be sure, in the wake of the Court\u2019s decision, plaintiffs\n\f2                        TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                       KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nwho challenge the legality of a new federal statute or\nexecutive action and request preliminary injunctive relief\nmay sometimes seek to proceed by class action under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and ask a court to\naward preliminary classwide relief that may, for example,\nbe statewide, regionwide, or even nationwide. See ante, at\n13\u201314; A. A. R. P. v. Trump, 605 U. S. ___, ___ (2025)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 7); Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S.\n682, 701\u2013703 (1979).            And in cases under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, plaintiffs may ask a court to\npreliminarily \u201cset aside\u201d a new agency rule. 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7706(2); see, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 577 U. S. 1126\n(2016); see also Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors, 603\nU. S. 799, 826\u2013843 (2024) (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring).1\n   But importantly, today\u2019s decision will require district\ncourts to follow proper legal procedures when awarding\nsuch relief. Most significantly, district courts can no longer\naward preliminary nationwide or classwide relief except\nwhen such relief is legally authorized. And that salutary\ndevelopment will help bring substantially more order and\ndiscipline to the ubiquitous preliminary litigation over new\nfederal statutes and executive actions.\n   I write separately simply to underscore that this case\nfocuses on only one discrete aspect of the preliminary\nlitigation relating to major new federal statutes and\nexecutive actions\u2014namely, what district courts may do\nwith respect to those new statutes and executive actions in\nwhat might be called \u201cthe interim before the interim.\u201d\nAlthough district courts have received much of the\nattention (and criticism) in debates over the universal-\ninjunction issue, those courts generally do not have the last\nword when they grant or deny preliminary injunctions. The\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In addition, as the Court notes, an injunction granting complete relief\n\nto plaintiffs may also, as a practical matter, benefit nonparties.

The losing party in\nthe district court\u2014the defendant against whom an\ninjunction is granted, or the plaintiff who is denied an\ninjunction\u2014will often go to the court of appeals to seek a\ntemporary stay or injunction. And then the losing party in\nthe court of appeals may promptly come to this Court with\nan application for a stay or injunction. This Court has\ntherefore often acted as the ultimate decider of the interim\nlegal status of major new federal statutes and executive\nactions. See, e.g., Ohio v. EPA, 603 U. S. 279 (2024); Danco\nLaboratories, LLC v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 598\nU. S. ___ (2023); National Federation of Independent\nBusiness v. OSHA, 595 U.

S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2024)\n(KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in grant of stay) (slip op., at 2\u2013\n3).\n  After today\u2019s decision, that order of operations will not\nchange. In justiciable cases, this Court, not the district\ncourts or courts of appeals, will often still be the ultimate\ndecisionmaker as to the interim legal status of major new\nfederal statutes and executive actions\u2014that is, the interim\nlegal status for the several-year period before a final\ndecision on the merits.\n                             I\n  The Court\u2019s decision today focuses on the \u201cinterim before\nthe interim\u201d\u2014the preliminary relief that district courts can\naward (and courts of appeals can approve) for the generally\nweeks-long interim before this Court can assess and settle\nthe matter for the often years-long interim before a final\ndecision on the merits. To appreciate the broader context\nsurrounding today\u2019s decision, it is important to understand\n\f4                    TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nthis Court\u2019s role in preliminary litigation of this sort.\n    The basic scenario in these kinds of applications to this\nCourt is by now familiar. Congress passes a major new\nstatute, or the Executive Branch issues a major new rule or\nexecutive order. The litigation over the legality of the new\nstatute or executive action winds its way through the\nfederal courts. And that litigation may meander on for\nmany months or often years before this Court can issue a\nfinal ruling deciding the legality of the new statute or\nexecutive action.\n    In the meantime, various plaintiffs may seek preliminary\ninjunctions, sometimes in many different district courts.\nAnd a government defendant against whom a preliminary\ninjunction is granted (or a plaintiff who is denied a\npreliminary injunction) may seek a temporary stay or\ninjunction in the court of appeals and then in this Court.\n    That preliminary-injunction litigation\u2014which typically\ntakes place at a rapid-fire pace long before the merits\nlitigation culminates several years down the road\u2014raises a\nquestion: What should the interim legal status of the\nsignificant new federal statute or executive action at issue\nbe during the several-year period before this Court\u2019s final\nruling on the merits?\n    That interim-status question is itself immensely\nimportant. The issue of whether a major new federal\nstatute or executive action \u201cis enforceable during the\nseveral years while the parties wait for a final merits ruling\n. . . raises a separate question of extraordinary significance\nto the parties and the American people.\u201d Labrador v. Poe,\n601 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2024) (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nin grant of stay) (slip op., at 2\u20133).\n    The interim-status issue in turn raises two other critical\nquestions: Should there be a nationally uniform answer on\nthe question of whether a major new federal statute or\nexecutive action can be legally enforced in the often years-\nlong interim period until this Court reaches a final decision\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)            5\n\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\non the merits? If so, who decides what the nationally\nuniform interim answer is?\n  First, in my view, there often (perhaps not always, but\noften) should be a nationally uniform answer on whether a\nmajor new federal statute, rule, or executive order can be\nenforced throughout the United States during the several-\nyear interim period until its legality is finally decided on\nthe merits.\n  Consider just a few of the major executive actions that\nhave been the subject of intense preliminary-injunction or\nother pre-enforcement litigation in the past 10 years or so,\nunder Presidents of both political parties. They range from\ntravel bans to birthright citizenship, from the Clean Power\nPlan to student loan forgiveness, from the OSHA vaccine\nmandate to the service of transgender individuals in the\nmilitary, from Title IX regulations to abortion drugs. And\nthe list goes on. Those executive actions often are highly\nsignificant and have widespread effects on many\nindividuals,    businesses,     governments,     and     other\norganizations throughout the United States.\n  Often, it is not especially workable or sustainable or\ndesirable to have a patchwork scheme, potentially for\nseveral years, in which a major new federal statute or\nexecutive action of that kind applies to some people or\norganizations in certain States or regions, but not to others.\nThe national reach of many businesses and government\nprograms, as well as the regular movement of the American\npeople into and out of different States and regions, would\nmake it difficult to sensibly maintain such a scattershot\nsystem of federal law.\n  Second, if one agrees that the years-long interim status\nof a highly significant new federal statute or executive\naction should often be uniform throughout the United\nStates, who decides what the interim status is?\n  The answer typically will be this Court, as has been the\ncase both traditionally and recently. This Court\u2019s actions\n\f6                       TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                      KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nin resolving applications for interim relief help provide\nclarity and uniformity as to the interim legal status of\nmajor new federal statutes, rules, and executive orders. In\nparticular, the Court\u2019s disposition of applications for\ninterim relief often will effectively settle, de jure or de facto,\nthe interim legal status of those statutes or executive\nactions nationwide.\n   The decision today will not alter this Court\u2019s traditional\nrole in those matters. Going forward, in the wake of a major\nnew federal statute or executive action, different district\ncourts may enter a slew of preliminary rulings on the\nlegality of that statute or executive action.                  Or\nalternatively, perhaps a district court (or courts) will grant\nor deny the functional equivalent of a universal\ninjunction\u2014for example, by granting or denying a\npreliminary injunction to a putative nationwide class under\nRule 23(b)(2), or by preliminarily setting aside or declining\nto set aside an agency rule under the APA.\n   No matter how the preliminary-injunction litigation on\nthose kinds of significant matters transpires in the district\ncourts, the courts of appeals in turn will undoubtedly be\ncalled upon to promptly grant or deny temporary stays or\ntemporary injunctions in many cases.\n   And regardless of whether the district courts have issued\na series of individual preliminary rulings, or instead have\nissued one or more broader classwide or set-aside\npreliminary rulings, the losing parties in the courts of\nappeals will regularly come to this Court in matters\ninvolving major new federal statutes and executive\nactions.2\n   If there is no classwide or set-aside relief in those kinds\nof nationally significant matters, then one would expect a\nflood of decisions from lower courts, after which the losing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 By statute, some litigation may start in a court of appeals or three-\n\njudge district court and then come directly to this Court.\n\f                      Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)                     7\n\n                       KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nparties on both sides will probably inundate this Court with\napplications for stays or injunctions.3 And in cases where\nclasswide or set-aside relief has been awarded, the losing\nside in the lower courts will likewise regularly come to this\nCourt if the matter is sufficiently important.\n  When a stay or injunction application arrives here, this\nCourt should not and cannot hide in the tall grass. When\nwe receive such an application, we must grant or deny.4\nAnd when we do\u2014that is, when this Court makes a decision\non the interim legal status of a major new federal statute or\nexecutive action\u2014that decision will often constitute a form\nof precedent (de jure or de facto) that provides guidance\nthroughout the United States during the years-long interim\nperiod until a final decision on the merits.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 That scenario explains why it would not make much sense for this\n\nCourt to apply different standards to (i) an application for an injunction\nand (ii) an application for a stay of an injunction. See, e.g., Tandon v.\nNewsom, 593 U. S. 61, 64 (2021) (per curiam) (applying the usual stay\nstandard to an application for an injunction).\n   Suppose a district court in Circuit A enjoins a new executive action.\nAnd the court of appeals in Circuit A then declines to stay the injunction.\nMeanwhile, a district court in Circuit B does not enjoin that new\nexecutive action, and the court of appeals in Circuit B also declines to\nenjoin it. Both cases come to this Court on applications for interim\nrelief\u2014one seeking a stay of injunction and one seeking an injunction. It\nwould not be particularly rational to deny a stay and leave the injunction\nin place in Circuit A, and then to turn around and deny an injunction in\nCircuit B on account of a purportedly higher standard for this Court to\ngrant injunctions rather than stays. The standards should mesh so that\nthis Court can ensure uniformity without regard to the happenstance of\nhow various courts of appeals and district courts ruled.\n   4 To obtain an interim stay or injunction, \u201can applicant must show (1) a\n\nreasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue\nsufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari; (2) a fair prospect that a\nmajority of the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below; and (3) a\nlikelihood that irreparable harm will result from the denial\u201d of the\napplication. Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U. S. 183, 190 (2010) (per\ncuriam); see Tandon, 593 U. S., at 64. The Court may also consider\n(4) the \u201cbalance\u201d of \u201cthe equities\u201d and \u201crelative harms\u201d to the parties.\nHollingsworth, 558 U. S., at 190.\n\f8                   TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\n                               II\n   It is sometimes suggested, however, that this Court\nshould adopt a policy of presumptively denying applications\nfor stays or injunctions\u2014even applications involving\nsignificant new federal statutes or executive actions\u2014\nregardless of which way the various lower courts have\nruled. That suggestion is flawed, in my view, because it\nwould often leave an unworkable or intolerable patchwork\nof federal law in place. And even in cases where there is no\npatchwork\u2014for example, because an application comes to\nus with a single nationwide class-action injunction\u2014what\nif this Court thinks the lower court\u2019s decision is wrong? On\nstudent loan forgiveness or the Clean Power Plan or\nmifepristone or the travel bans, for example? Should we\nhave a rule of presumptively denying relief, thereby\nallowing erroneous injunctions (or erroneous denials of\ninjunctions) of major new statutes and executive actions to\nremain in place for several years, and thus severely\nharming the Government and would-be beneficiaries of (or\nregulated parties under) those new statutes and executive\nactions? I think not. And this Court\u2019s actions over the years\nreflect that the Court thinks not.\n   Unless and until this Court grants or denies an\napplication for stay or injunction, tremendous uncertainty\nmay surround the interim legal status of the new federal\nstatute or executive action throughout the country. The\nstatute or executive action may be in effect in some places\nbut not others, for some businesses but not others, for some\nAmericans but not others. That temporary geographic,\norganizational, and individual variation in federal law\nmight not warrant this Court\u2019s intervention in run-of-the-\nmill cases\u2014which is why it makes sense that this Court\ndenies applications for interim relief when the Court is\nunlikely to later grant certiorari. See Does 1\u20133 v. Mills, 595\nU. S. ___, ___ (2021) (BARRETT, J., concurring in denial of\napplication for injunctive relief ). But in cases involving\n\f                   Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)              9\n\n                    KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nmajor new federal statutes or executive actions, uniformity\nis often essential or at least sensible and prudent. In those\nkinds of cases, disuniformity\u2014even if only for a few years\nor less\u2014can be chaotic. And such chaos is not good for the\nlaw or the country.\n   One of this Court\u2019s roles, in justiciable cases, is to resolve\nmajor legal questions of national importance and ensure\nuniformity of federal law. So a default policy of off-loading\nto lower courts the final word on whether to green-light or\nblock major new federal statutes and executive actions for\nthe several-year interim until a final ruling on the merits\nwould seem to amount to an abdication of this Court\u2019s\nproper role.\n   Some might object that this Court is not well equipped to\nmake those significant decisions\u2014namely, decisions about\nthe interim status of a major new federal statute or\nexecutive action\u2014on an expedited basis. But district courts\nand courts of appeals are likewise not perfectly equipped to\nmake expedited preliminary judgments on important\nmatters of this kind. Yet they have to do so, and so do we.\nBy law, federal courts are open and can receive and review\napplications for relief 24/7/365. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7452 (\u201cAll\ncourts of the United States shall be deemed always open for\nthe purpose of filing proper papers . . . and making motions\nand orders\u201d). And this Court has procedural tools that can\nhelp us make the best possible interim decision in the\nlimited time available\u2014administrative stays, additional\nbriefing, amicus briefs, oral argument, certiorari before\njudgment, and the like. On top of that, this Court has nine\nJustices, each of whom can (and does) consult and\ndeliberate with the other eight to help the Court determine\nthe best answer, unlike a smaller three-judge court of\nappeals panel or one-judge district court. And this Court\nalso will have the benefit of the prior decisions in the case\nat hand from the court of appeals and the district court.\n   Some might argue that preliminary disputes over the\n\f10                  TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nlegality of major new statutes and executive actions can\ndraw this Court into difficult or controversial matters\nearlier than we might like, as distinct from what happens\non our slower-moving merits docket.              That is an\nunderstandable concern. But when it comes to the interim\nstatus of major new federal statutes and executive actions,\nit is often important for reasons of clarity, stability, and\nuniformity that this Court be the decider. And Members of\nthe Court have life tenure so that we can make tough calls\nwithout fear or favor. As with the merits docket, the Court\u2019s\nrole in resolving applications for interim relief is to\nneutrally referee each matter based on the relevant legal\nstandard. Avoiding controversial or difficult decisions on\nthose applications is neither feasible nor appropriate.\n   Some might also worry that an early or rushed decision\non an application could \u201clock in\u201d the Court\u2019s assessment of\nthe merits and subtly deter the Court from later making a\ndifferent final decision. But in deciding applications for\ninterim relief involving major new statutes or executive\nactions, we often have no choice but to make a preliminary\nassessment of likelihood of success on the merits; after all,\nin cases of that sort, the other relevant factors (irreparable\nharm and the equities) are often very weighty on both sides.\nSee Labrador v. Poe, 601 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2024)\n(KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in grant of stay) (slip op., at 3\u2013\n4). Moreover, judges strive to make the correct decision\nbased on current information notwithstanding any previous\nassessment of the merits earlier in the litigation. It is not\nuncommon to think and decide differently when one knows\nmore. This Court has done so in the past, see West Virginia\nBd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943), and\nundoubtedly will continue to do so in the future.\n   To reiterate, this Court should not insert itself into run-\nof-the-mill preliminary-injunction cases where we are not\nlikely to grant certiorari down the road. But determining\nthe nationally uniform interim legal status for several years\n\f                 Cite as: 606 U.

That trend is in part the result of the increasing\nnumber of major new executive actions by recent\nPresidential administrations (of both political parties) that\nhave had difficulty passing significant new legislation\nthrough Congress. Meanwhile, applications for stays or\ninjunctions in capital-punishment cases, election disputes,\nand other time-sensitive matters (including numerous\nCOVID\u201319-related disputes in the few years beginning in\n2020) have also continued to come to this Court on a steady\nbasis, as they traditionally have.\n  Although the volume of applications has increased, the\nCourt\u2019s    responsibility    for   deciding   consequential\napplications for stays or injunctions is not new. See, e.g.,\nWest Virginia v. EPA, 577 U. S. 1126 (2016) (temporarily\nenjoining Clean Power Plan); Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S.\n1 (2006) (per curiam) (vacating injunction pending appeal\nregarding state voter ID law); Rubin v. United States, 524\nU. S. 1301 (1998) (Rehnquist, C.

Deciding those\napplications is not a distraction from our job. It is a critical\npart of our job.

That has been the legal rule\nsince the founding, and it was the English rule well before\nthen. This Court once attempted to repudiate it, holding in\nDred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), that the chil-\ndren of enslaved black Americans were not citizens. To\nremedy that grievous error, Congress passed in 1866 and\nthe States ratified in 1868 the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s\nCitizenship Clause, which enshrined birthright citizenship in\n\f2                   TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe Constitution. There it has remained, accepted and re-\nspected by Congress, by the Executive, and by this Court.\nUntil today.\n   It is now the President who attempts, in an Executive Or-\nder (Order or Citizenship Order), to repudiate birthright\ncitizenship. Every court to evaluate the Order has deemed\nit patently unconstitutional and, for that reason, has en-\njoined the Federal Government from enforcing it. Unde-\nterred, the Government now asks this Court to grant emer-\ngency relief, insisting it will suffer irreparable harm unless\nit can deprive at least some children born in the United\nStates of citizenship. See Protecting the Meaning and\nValue of American Citizenship, Exec. Order No. 14160, 90\nFed. Reg. 8849 (2025).\n   The Government does not ask for complete stays of the\ninjunctions, as it ordinarily does before this Court. Why?\nThe answer is obvious: To get such relief, the Government\nwould have to show that the Order is likely constitutional,\nan impossible task in light of the Constitution\u2019s text, his-\ntory, this Court\u2019s precedents, federal law, and Executive\nBranch practice. So the Government instead tries its hand\nat a different game. It asks this Court to hold that, no mat-\nter how illegal a law or policy, courts can never simply tell\nthe Executive to stop enforcing it against anyone. Instead,\nthe Government says, it should be able to apply the Citizen-\nship Order (whose legality it does not defend) to everyone\nexcept the plaintiffs who filed this lawsuit.\n   The gamesmanship in this request is apparent and the\nGovernment makes no attempt to hide it. Yet, shamefully,\nthis Court plays along. A majority of this Court decides that\nthese applications, of all cases, provide the appropriate oc-\ncasion to resolve the question of universal injunctions and\nend the centuries-old practice once and for all. In its rush\nto do so the Court disregards basic principles of equity as\nwell as the long history of injunctive relief granted to non-\nparties.\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates.\nToday, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a\ndifferent administration may try to seize firearms from law-\nabiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from\ngathering to worship. The majority holds that, absent cum-\nbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely\nenjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so\nis necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief.\nThat holding renders constitutional guarantees meaningful\nin name only for any individuals who are not parties to a\nlawsuit. Because I will not be complicit in so grave an at-\ntack on our system of law, I dissent.\n                              I\n   The majority ignores entirely whether the President\u2019s Ex-\necutive Order is constitutional, instead focusing only on the\nquestion whether federal courts have the equitable author-\nity to issue universal injunctions. Yet the Order\u2019s patent\nunlawfulness reveals the gravity of the majority\u2019s error and\nunderscores why equity supports universal injunctions as\nappropriate remedies in this kind of case. As every conceiv-\nable source of law confirms, birthright citizenship is the law\nof the land.\n                               A\n  The Citizenship Clause provides that \u201c[a]ll persons born\nor naturalized in the United States and subject to the juris-\ndiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the\nState wherein they reside.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a71.\nThat means what it says. Nestled in the Fourteenth\nAmendment alongside the Equal Protection Clause, the\nCitizenship Clause does not discriminate on the basis of\nrace, sex, ethnicity, religion, or, importantly here, parent-\nage. It refers instead to \u201c[a]ll persons born or naturalized\nin the United States.\u201d Ibid.\n  Besides birth, there is only one condition: that one be\n\f4                    TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States. Yet that\ncondition too leaves no room for ambiguity. To be \u201csubject\nto the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States means simply to be\nbound to its authority and its laws. See N. Webster, An\nAmerican Dictionary of the English Language 732 (C.\nGoodrich & N. Porter eds. 1865) (defining jurisdiction as the\n\u201c[p]ower of governing or legislating,\u201d or \u201cthe power or right\nof exercising authority\u201d). As the Government would pre-\nsumably concede, virtually everyone born in the United\nStates and present in its territory is subject to its authority\nand its laws. After all, \u201c[t]he jurisdiction of the nation\nwithin its own territory is necessarily exclusive and abso-\nlute.\u201d Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 136\n(1812) (Marshall, C. J., for the Court). Once a citizen of an-\nother nation steps onto United States soil, she is (with nar-\nrow exception) \u201camenable to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United\nStates. Id., at 144. That is why \u201cno plausible distinction\nwith respect to Fourteenth Amendment \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 can be\ndrawn between resident aliens whose entry into the United\nStates was lawful, and resident aliens whose entry was un-\nlawful.\u201d Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 211, n. 10 (1982).\n  Few constitutional questions can be answered by resort\nto the text of the Constitution alone, but this is one. The\nFourteenth Amendment guarantees birthright citizenship.\n                              B\n  Unsurprisingly given the clarity of the Citizenship\nClause\u2019s text, every other source of interpretation confirms\nthis conclusion. Consider, first, its history. Long before the\nFourteenth Amendment, and indeed before the founding,\nthe common-law rule of jus soli (literally, right of the soil)\ngoverned English citizenship. That rule rendered a per-\nson\u2019s birthplace determinative of her citizenship status.\nThus, \u201cthe children of aliens, born . . . in England,\u201d gener-\nally were \u201cnatural-born subjects, and entitled to all the\nprivileges of such.\u201d 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)              5\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nLaws of England 361\u2013362 (1765); see also H. Broom & G.\nDenman, Constitutional Law Viewed in Relation to Com-\nmon Law 31 (2d ed. 1885) (describing Calvin\u2019s Case (1608),\nwhich established that \u201c[e]very one born within the domin-\nions of the King of England . . . is . . . entitled to enjoy all\nthe rights and liberties of an Englishman\u201d).\n   That English common-law rule carried over to the United\nStates after the founding. Shortly after the Constitution\u2019s\nratification, James Madison observed that \u201cit [was] an es-\ntablished maxim that birth is a criterion of allegiance,\u201d i.e.,\nof citizenship. 1 Annals of Cong. 404 (1789). Birth, he ex-\nplained, could convey citizenship in two ways: either\nthrough \u201cplace\u201d (under the \u201cright of the soil\u201d principle) or\nthrough \u201cparentage\u201d (as for one born to United States citi-\nzens). Ibid. \u201c[B]ut, in general,\u201d Madison explained, \u201cplace\nis the most certain criterion\u201d and \u201cit is what applies in the\nUnited States.\u201d Ibid. Mere decades later, Justice Story\nwrote that \u201c[n]othing is better settled . . . than the doctrine\nthat the children even of aliens born in a country . . . are\nsubjects by birth.\u201d Inglis v. Trustees of Sailor\u2019s Snug Har-\nbour in City of New York, 3 Pet. 99, 164 (1830). Well before\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, then, it was the undisputed\n\u201claw of the United States [that] every person born within\nthe dominions and allegiance of the United States, what-\never were the situation of his parents, is a natural born cit-\nizen.\u201d Lynch v. Clarke, 1 Sand. Ch. 583, 663 (N. Y. Ch.\n1844).\n   Though the law was clear, the Nation did not always live\nup to its promise. Infamously, this Court departed from the\nbirthright citizenship principle in Dred Scott, 19 How. 393,\nholding that the children of enslaved black Americans \u201care\nnot included, and were not intended to be included, under\nthe word \u2018citizens\u2019 in the Constitution.\u201d Id., at 404. Follow-\ning the Civil War, the Reconstruction Congress corrected\nthat grave error. Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866,\n14 Stat. 27, declared that \u201call persons born in the United\n\f6                    TRUMP v.

Indeed, some\nobjected to its passage on those grounds, complaining that\nit would permanently extend citizenship to immigrants who\n\u201cinvade [state] borders\u201d and \u201csettle as trespassers.\u201d Cong.\nGlobe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2891 (1866). Proponents\nagreed, if not with the anti-immigrant sentiment, that the\nClause would extend citizenship to the children of immi-\ngrants. For example, Senator Conness of California (one of\nthe Amendment\u2019s lead supporters) confirmed on the floor\n\u201cthat the children born here of Mongolian parents shall be\ndeclared by the Constitution of the United States to be en-\ntitled to civil rights and to equal protection before the law.\u201d\nId., at 2892. \u201cWe have declared that by law\u201d in the Civil\nRights Act, he explained, and \u201cnow it is proposed to incor-\nporate the same provision in the fundamental instrument\nof the nation.\u201d Id., at 2891.

Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649 (1898). At\nissue was the citizenship of Wong Kim Ark, a young Cali-\nfornia resident born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrant\nparents. Id., at 652. When Wong returned to California\nfrom a trip to China, a custom\u2019s collector denied him entry\non the sole ground that he was not a citizen of the United\nStates. Id., at 653.\n   This Court held that \u201c[t]he Fourteenth Amendment af-\nfirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by\nbirth within the territory.\u201d Id., at 693. As the President\ndoes today, the Government in Wong Kim Ark rested its\ncase on the Clause\u2019s sole qualifier. Wong was not subject to\nthe jurisdiction of the United States, the Government\nclaimed, because at birth his parents were aliens in the\nUnited States who were \u201csubjects of the emperor of China,\u201d\nthus making Wong a subject of the emperor of China as\nwell. Id., at 652\u2013653. This Court squarely rejected that\nattempt to limit the Citizenship Clause\u2019s reach. Instead, it\nheld, the \u201c \u2018subject to the jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d qualifier excludes\nonly \u201cchildren born of alien enemies in hostile occupation,\nand children of diplomatic representatives of a foreign\nState,\u201d id., at 682, \u201cwith the single additional exception of\nchildren of members of the Indian tribes owing direct alle-\ngiance to their several tribes,\u201d id., at 693.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The first two exceptions \u201cha[d] already been shown, by the law of Eng-\n\nland and by our own law, from the time of the first settlement of the\nEnglish colonies in America, [to be] recognized exceptions to the funda-\nmental rule of citizenship by birth within the country.\u201d Wong Kim Ark,\n169 U. S., at 682. The additional exception for certain children born to\nIndian tribe members reflected the country\u2019s historical understanding\nthat Indian tribes were \u201cquasi foreign nations\u201d within the physical\nboundaries of the United States. See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess.,\n\f8                        TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   That holding conclusively settled any remaining dispute\nover the Citizenship Clause\u2019s meaning. Since then, all\nthree branches of Government have unflinchingly adhered\nto it.\n   This Court, for one, has repeatedly reaffirmed Wong Kim\nArk\u2019s holding. Notwithstanding legislation purporting to\nrender Japanese persons \u201cineligible\u201d for citizenship, we\nheld in Morrison v. California, 291 U. S. 82 (1934), that a\nchild with Japanese parents \u201cis a citizen of the United\nStates if he was born within the United States.\u201d Id., at 85.\nThe Court recognized the same rule even during World War\nII, when individuals of Japanese ancestry were subject to\ncurfew and exclusion orders. See Hirabayashi v. United\nStates, 320 U. S. 81, 96\u201397 (1943). So too has the Court\nrecognized that the child of parents unlawfully present in\nthe United States \u201cis, of course, an American citizen by\nbirth.\u201d United States ex rel. Hintopoulos v. Shaughnessy,\n353 U. S. 72, 73 (1957). The same is true of children whose\nparents gained admission into the United States by unlaw-\nful means. See, e.g., INS v. Errico, 385 U.

CASA, INC.\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   All three District Courts preliminarily enjoined enforce-\nment of the Citizenship Order. Each court determined that\nthe Citizenship Order was likely unlawful, that respond-\nents were likely to face irreparable harm without an injunc-\ntion, and that the equities and public interest cut decisively\nin respondents\u2019 favor. See 763 F. Supp. 3d 723, 727, 744\u2013\n745 (Md. 2025); 765 F. Supp. 3d 1142, 1152\u20131153 (WD\nWash. 2025); Doe v. Trump, 766 F. Supp. 3d 266, 274, 285\u2013\n287 (Mass. 2025).\n   The District Courts further determined that only injunc-\ntions blocking the Citizenship Order\u2019s enforcement nation-\nwide would completely redress respondents\u2019 injuries. For\nthe organizational plaintiffs, the Maryland District Court\nexplained that those plaintiffs have \u201c \u2018over 680,000 mem-\nbers . . . who reside in all 50 U.S. states\u2019 \u201d and \u201chundreds of\nthem expect to give birth soon.\u201d 763 F. Supp. 3d, at 746.\nThe Washington District Court found that \u201ca geograph-\nically limited injunction would be ineffective\u201d for the state\nplaintiffs \u201cas it would not completely relieve [the States] of\nthe Order\u2019s financial burden(s).\u201d 765 F. Supp. 3d, at 1153.\nFor one thing, that court explained, the constant flow of\npeople moving in and out of various States meant some chil-\ndren born to noncitizen parents in a nonplaintiff State\nwould later reside in a plaintiff State. Once there, those\nchildren (under state law) would be eligible for state bene-\nfits. Yet due to the Citizenship Order, the plaintiff States\nwould no longer receive federal funding to support those\nbenefits. In addition, the plaintiff States would have to cre-\nate an entirely new administrative and recordkeeping sys-\ntem to accommodate children who were not citizens under\nthe Order and born in a nonplaintiff State. So if the District\nCourt allowed birthright citizenship to continue for chil-\ndren born in the plaintiff States, but not in any other State,\nthat would not completely redress the States\u2019 financial in-\njury.

Supp.\n3d, at 288 (\u201cThe harms [the States] have established stem\nfrom the [Order\u2019s] impact on the citizenship status\u2014and\nthe ability to discern or verify such status\u2014for any child\nlocated or seeking various services within their jurisdic-\ntion\u201d).\n    The Government filed motions to stay the injunctions in\nthree separate Courts of Appeals. Nowhere did the Govern-\nment contest the District Courts\u2019 uniform holdings that the\nCitizenship Order likely violated the Constitution. Instead,\nit challenged only the scope of the ordered relief, arguing\nthat the injunctions should be narrowed to block the Order\u2019s\nenforcement against only the individual persons named in\nthe complaints.\n    All three appellate courts denied the Government\u2019s re-\nquest and left the preliminary injunctions intact. See 131\nF. 4th 27 (CA1 2025); 2025 WL 654902 (CA4, Feb. 28, 2025);\n2025 WL 553485 (CA9, Feb. 19, 2025). The Fourth Circuit,\nwhich reviewed the preliminary injunction issued to the or-\nganizational plaintiffs, concluded that \u201c[t]he district court\n. . . carefully explained why an injunction limited to the par-\nties\u2014including organizations with hundreds of thousands\nof members nationwide\u2014would be unworkable in practice\nand thus fail to provide complete relie[f] to the plaintiffs.\u201d\n2025 WL 654902, *1. The First and Ninth Circuits left un-\ndisturbed the Massachusetts and Washington District\nCourts\u2019 respective determinations that only universal in-\njunctions would fully redress the States\u2019 injuries. See 131\nF. 4th, 42\u201343; 2025 WL 553485, *1.\n    On March 13, the Government filed emergency applica-\ntions with this Court requesting partial stays of the three\npreliminary injunctions of the Citizenship Order. The Gov-\nernment renews its contention that the injunctions must be\nnarrowed to benefit only formal parties in these cases.\n\f14                    TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                     SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                                III\n   In partially granting the Government\u2019s remarkable re-\nquest, the Court distorts well-established equitable princi-\nples several times over. A stay, this Court has said, \u201c \u2018is not\na matter of right,\u2019 \u201d but rather \u201c \u2018an exercise of judicial dis-\ncretion.\u2019 \u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 433 (2009). For\ncenturies, courts have \u201cclose[d] the doors\u201d of equity to those\n\u201ctainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to the\nmatter in which [they] seek relief.\u201d Precision Instrument\nMfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co., 324\nU. S. 806, 814 (1945). Yet the majority throws the doors of\nequity open to the Government in a case where it seeks to\nundo a fundamental and clearly established constitutional\nright. The Citizenship Order\u2019s patent unlawfulness is rea-\nson enough to deny the Government\u2019s applications.\n   The Government also falls well short of satisfying its bur-\nden to show that it will likely suffer irreparable harm ab-\nsent a stay and that it will likely succeed on the merits of\nits challenge to the scope of the injunctions. Nken, 556\nU. S., at 434\u2013435. The Executive Branch has respected\nbirthright citizenship for well over a century, and it ad-\nvances no plausible reason why maintaining the status quo\nwhile the litigation proceeds would cause it irrevocable\nharm. Nor could it, for the Constitution and federal law\nprohibit the enforcement of the Citizenship Order.\n   For all that, moreover, the Government is not even cor-\nrect on the merits of universal injunctions. To the contrary,\nuniversal injunctions are consistent with long-established\nprinciples of equity, once respected by this Court. What is\nmore, these cases do not even squarely present the legality\nof universal injunctions. That is because, even if the major-\nity were right that injunctions can only offer \u201ccomplete re-\nlief to the plaintiffs before the court,\u201d ante, at 17, each of the\nlower courts here correctly determined that the nationwide\nrelief they issued was necessary to remedy respondents\u2019 in-\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U.

So even ignoring the traditional stay fac-\ntors and accepting the majority\u2019s view of the merits, there\nis no reason to grant relief in these cases.\n                               A\n   It is a bedrock principle that parties who request a stay\nmust show they will likely suffer irreparable harm absent\nsuch relief. Indeed, \u201c[t]he authority to grant stays has his-\ntorically been justified by the perceived need \u2018to prevent ir-\nreparable injury to the parties or to the public\u2019 pending re-\nview.\u201d Nken, 556 U. S., at 432 (quoting Scripps-Howard\nRadio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U. S. 4, 9 (1942)). Thus, an appar-\nent likelihood of success on the merits never suffices on its\nown to justify this Court\u2019s intervention: Our emergency\ndocket is not a mechanism for an expedited appeal. Accord-\ningly, \u201cthis Court can avoid delving into the merits\u201d \u201c[i]f the\n[applicant does not] demonstrat[e] an irreparable injury.\u201d\nLabrador v. Poe, 601 U. S. ___, ___ (2024) (KAVANAUGH, J.,\nconcurring in grant of stay) (slip op., at 3); contra, ante, at\n8\u201311 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring).\n   What grave harm does the Executive face that prompts a\nmajority of this Court to grant it relief? The answer, the\nGovernment says, is the inability to enforce the Citizenship\nOrder against nonparties. For the majority, that answer\nsuffices. See ante, at 24 (\u201cWhen a federal court enters a\nuniversal injunction against the Government, it \u2018im-\nproper[ly] intrude[s]\u2019 on \u2018a coordinate branch of the Govern-\nment\u2019 and prevents the Government from enforcing its pol-\nicies against nonparties\u201d).\n   The problem, however, is that the Executive Branch has\nno right to enforce the Citizenship Order against anyone.\nAs the Executive itself once put it, the Order is \u201cunques-\ntionably unconstitutional.\u201d Supra, at 9. It defies logic to\nsay that maintaining a centuries-long status quo for a few\nmonths longer will irreparably injure the Government. See\nStarbucks Corp. v. McKinney, 602 U. S. 339, 345\u2013346\n\f16                   TRUMP v.

The President\u2019s \u201cmandate . . . to ex-\nercise his executive power,\u201d Myers v. United States, 272\nU. S. 52, 123 (1926), in any event, does not permit him to\nrewrite the Constitution or statutory provisions at a whim.\nBy forging ahead and granting relief to the Government an-\nyway, this Court endorses the radical proposition that the\nPresident is harmed, irreparably, whenever he cannot do\nsomething he wants to do, even if what he wants to do is\nbreak the law.\n   The majority claims that it can sidestep \u201canalysis of the\nExecutive Order\u201d altogether because (in its view) every\noverbroad injunction necessarily causes irreparable harm\nsufficient to warrant emergency intervention. Ante, at 24.\nYet where a purportedly overbroad injunction orders the\nGovernment to do only what this Court has expressly held\nit is required to do, it is hard to see how it could cause any\nharm. At oral argument, the Government conceded it was\nbound to follow this Court\u2019s precedent. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n62\u201363. This Court\u2019s precedent establishes beyond a shade\nof doubt that the Executive Order is unconstitutional. See\nsupra, at 3\u20139. Thus, by enjoining the Government from vi-\nolating settled law, the District Courts\u2019 orders do not cause\nthe Government any harm.\n   The majority\u2019s contrary position is self-refuting. Suppose\nan executive order barred women from receiving unemploy-\nment benefits or black citizens from voting. Is the Govern-\nment irreparably harmed, and entitled to emergency relief,\nby a district court order universally enjoining such policies?\nThe majority, apparently, would say yes.\n   Nothing in this Court\u2019s precedents supports that result.\nIt turns one of the \u201c \u2018most critical\u2019 factors we must consider\nin deciding whether to grant a stay\u201d into a box-checking ex-\nercise whenever the relevant enjoined action is an executive\none.

The injunctions do no more harm to\nthe Executive than the Constitution and federal law do.\n                              B\n   A majority of this Court nonetheless rushes to address\nthe merits of the Government\u2019s applications, holding that\nuniversal injunctions \u201clikely exceed the equitable authority\nthat Congress has granted to federal courts.\u201d Ante, at 1\u20132.\nA majority that has repeatedly pledged its fealty to \u201chistory\nand tradition\u201d thus eliminates an equitable power firmly\ngrounded in centuries of equitable principles and practice.\nBy stripping all federal courts, including itself, of that\npower, the Court kneecaps the Judiciary\u2019s authority to stop\nthe Executive from enforcing even the most unconstitu-\ntional policies.

The American legal system grew out\nof English law, which had two primary judicial institutions:\nthe common-law courts and equity courts. Equity courts\narose because of the inflexibility of the common-law system;\ntheir purpose was to look beyond formal writs and provide\nremedies where the common law gave inadequate relief.

While com-\nmon-law courts were \u201ccompelled to limit their inquiry to the\nvery parties in the litigation before them,\u201d equity courts\ncould \u201cadjust the rights of all, however numerous,\u201d and\n\u201cadapt their decrees to all the varieties of circumstances,\nwhich may arise, and adjust them to all the peculiar rights\nof all the parties in interest.\u201d J.

For centuries, they did so through what\nwas known as \u201cbills of peace.\u201d If a plaintiff or group of\nplaintiffs filed such a bill, an English court could use a sin-\ngle case to settle disputes affecting whole communities, for\n\u201cthe inherent jurisdiction of equity\u201d included the power \u201cto\ninterfere for the prevention of a multiplicity of suits.\u201d 1 J.\nPomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7260, p. 278 (1881). Bills\nof peace issued in cases \u201c \u2018where the parties [were] very nu-\nmerous, and the court perceive[d] that it [would] be almost\nimpossible to bring them all before the court; or where the\nquestion is of general interest, and a few may sue for the\nbenefit of the whole.\u2019 \u201d Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S.\n815, 832 (1999) (quoting West v. Randall, 29 F. Cas. 718,\n722 (No. 17,424) (CC RI 1820) (Story, J.)). In such cases, a\ncourt could \u201cgrant [equitable relief] without making other\npersons parties,\u201d instead considering them \u201cquasi parties to\nthe record, at least for the purpose of taking the benefit of\nthe decree, and of entitling themselves to other equitable\nrelief, if their rights [were] jeopard[iz]ed.\u201d Id., at 723.\n   Early American courts embraced bills of peace and ex-\ntended their logic to cases \u201cwhich [were] not technically\n\u2018bills of peace,\u2019 but \u2018[were] analogous to,\u2019 or \u2018within the prin-\nciple\u2019 of such bills.\u201d 1 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7269,\nat 293. One example was taxpayer suits, which allowed\ncourts to enjoin universally the enforcement of a challenged\ntax. Sometimes, such suits were filed \u201cby any number of\ntaxpayers joined as co-plaintiffs, or by one taxpayer suing\n\f20                   TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\non behalf of himself and all others similarly situated.\u201d Id.,\nat 277. But taxpayer suits were not always representative\nin nature: Even \u201ca single taxpayer suing on his own ac-\ncount,\u201d if victorious, could enjoin the collection of a tax\nagainst anyone. Ibid. Individual plaintiffs, moreover, could\nsecure an order \u201cto set aside and annul any and every illegal\npublic official action . . . whereby a debt . . . would be un-\nlawfully created.\u201d Ibid. By allowing \u201ccomplete and final\nrelief [to] be given to an entire community by means of one\njudicial decree,\u201d American courts (like their English coun-\nterparts) spared nonparties and themselves from the bur-\nden of \u201can indefinite amount of separate litigation.\u201d Id., at\n278.\n   Federal courts have also exercised equitable authority to\nenjoin universally federal and state laws for more than a\ncentury. For instance, before deciding the constitutionality\nof a new federal law in Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan, 229\nU. S. 288 (1913), this Court entered an order blocking the\nlaw\u2019s enforcement against parties and nonparties. See M.\nSohoni, The Lost History of the \u201cUniversal\u201d Injunction, 133\nHarv. L. Rev. 920, 944\u2013946 (2020). In Lewis, two newspa-\nper publishers challenged as unconstitutional a federal law\nrequiring publishers to file with the Postmaster General\ntwice-yearly disclosures about their editorial board mem-\nbership, corporate ownership, and subscribership. Sohoni,\n133 Harv. L. Rev., at 944. After the District Court upheld\nthe law and authorized a direct appeal to the Supreme\nCourt, one of the publishers moved for a restraining order.\nThe proposed order sought relief not only for the publisher\nwho filed it, but asked the Court to \u201c \u2018restrai[n]\u2019 \u201d the Post-\nmaster General and other federal officials from enforcing\nthe law against \u201c \u2018appellant and other newspaper publish-\ners.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 946. This Court readily agreed, see Journal of\nCommerce and Commercial Bulletin v. Burleson, 229 U. S.\n600, 601 (1913) (per curiam), even as it would have sufficed\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U.

Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925), too,\nthis Court affirmed a universal injunction of Oregon\u2019s com-\npulsory public schooling law. See Sohoni, 133 Harv.\nL. Rev., at 959\u2013962. Two private school owners challenged\nthat law in a suit against the Governor of Oregon and other\nstate officials. \u201cThe plaintiffs did not sue on behalf of a rep-\nresented group or class; they sued for themselves, alleging\nthat the law was an unconstitutional interference with\ntheir property rights.\u201d Id., at 959. Yet a three-judge federal\ncourt awarded them a universal injunction. See id., at 960\u2013\n961. This Court, in affirming that relief, twice described it\nas \u201cappropriate.\u201d Pierce, 268 U. S., at 530, 533. The Court\nunderstood that the injunction it affirmed would provide re-\nlief to nonparties, commenting that such relief was neces-\nsary because enforcing the Act would result not only in the\n\u201cdestruction of appellees\u2019 primary schools,\u201d but would also\ndestroy \u201cperhaps all other private primary schools for nor-\nmal children within the State of Oregon.\u201d Id., at 534.\n   Cases like Lewis and Pierce were not outliers. Through-\nout the early 20th century, federal courts granted universal\ninjunctions even when a narrower remedy would have suf-\nficed to redress the parties\u2019 injuries. See, e.g., West Virginia\nBd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943) (affirming\nan injunction that shielded the plaintiff class of Jehovah\u2019s\nWitnesses, and any other children with religious scruples,\nfrom complying with a state law requiring children to sa-\nlute the American flag); see also Sohoni, 133 Harv. L. Rev.,\nat 943\u2013993 (collecting cases). It is certainly true that fed-\neral courts have granted more universal injunctions of fed-\neral laws in recent decades. But the issuance of broad eq-\nuitable relief intended to benefit parties and nonparties has\ndeep roots in equity\u2019s history and in this Court\u2019s precedents.\n   The universal injunctions of the Citizenship Order fit\n\f22                    TRUMP v.

See 1 Pomeroy, Eq-\nuity Jurisprudence \u00a7260, at 450\u2013451. Complete justice, the\n\u201cconstant aim\u201d of equity, Story, Commentaries on Equity\nPleadings \u00a772, at 74, demands a universal injunction: \u201c \u2018the\nonly remedy which the law allows to prevent the commis-\nsion\u2019 \u201d of a flagrantly illegal policy. Arthur, 63 F., at 328.\nThe District Courts, by granting such relief, appropriately\n\u201csettle[d] the rights of all persons interested in the subject-\nmatter\u201d of these suits, binding the Government so as to pre-\nvent needless \u201cfuture litigation.\u201d Story, Commentaries on\nEquity Pleadings \u00a772, at 74.\n   Of course, as a matter of equitable discretion, courts may\noften have weighty reasons not to award universal relief.\nAmong other things, universal injunctions can prevent dif-\nferent district and appellate courts from considering the\nsame issues in parallel, forestalling the legal dialogue (or\n\u201cpercolation\u201d) the federal system uses to answer difficult\nquestions correctly. Not so here, however, because the Cit-\nizenship Order is patently unconstitutional under settled\nlaw and a variety of district and appellate courts have re-\nviewed the issue. So too can universal injunctions encour-\nage forum shopping, by allowing preferred district judges in\na venue picked by one plaintiff to enjoin governmental pol-\nicies nationwide. They also operate asymmetrically against\nthe Government, giving plaintiffs a litigation advantage: To\nhalt Government action everywhere, a plaintiff must win\n\f                    Cite as: 606 U.

Yet this is not a scenario where granting universal\nrelief will encourage forum shopping or give plaintiffs the\nupper hand. Quite the opposite: By awarding universal re-\nlief below, the District Courts just ordered the Government\nto do everywhere what any reasonable jurist would order\nthe Government to do anywhere.\n   There may be good reasons not to issue universal injunc-\ntions in the typical case, when the merits are open to rea-\nsonable disagreement and there is no claim of extraordi-\nnary and imminent irreparable harm.3               See Story,\nCommentaries on Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7959a, at 227 (\u201c[In-\njunctive relief] ought . . . to be guarded with extreme cau-\ntion, and applied only in very clear cases\u201d); cf. ante, at 13 (\n\u201c[The] use [of bills of peace] was confined to limited circum-\nstances\u201d). The universal injunctions in these cases, how-\never, are more than appropriate. These injunctions, after\nall, protect newborns from the exceptional, irreparable\nharm associated with losing a foundational constitutional\nright and its immediate benefits. They thus honor the most\nbasic value of our constitutional system: They keep the Gov-\nernment within the bounds of law. Marbury v.

In reaching that ahistorical result, the Court\nclaims that the English Chancellor\u2019s remedies were \u201ctypi-\ncally\u201d party specific, and emphasizes that party-specific\nprinciples have permeated this Court\u2019s understanding of\nequity. Ante, at 6\u20139.\n   The majority\u2019s argument stumbles out the gate. As the\nmajority must itself concede, injunctions issued by English\ncourts of equity were \u201ctypically,\u201d but not always, party spe-\ncific. Ante, at 7. After all, bills of peace, for centuries, al-\nlowed English courts to adjudicate the rights of parties not\nbefore it, and to award remedies intended to benefit entire\naffected communities. Taxpayer suits, too, could lead to a\ncomplete injunction of a tax, even when only a single plain-\ntiff filed suit.\n   The majority seeks to distinguish bills of peace from uni-\nversal injunctions by urging that the former (but not the\nlatter) typically applied to small and cohesive groups and\nwere representative in nature. See ante, at 13. Yet those\nare distinctions without a difference. Equity courts had the\nflexibility to \u201cadapt their decrees to all the varieties of cir-\ncumstances, which may arise, and adjust them to all the\npeculiar rights of all the parties in interest.\u201d Story, Com-\nmentaries on Equity Jurisprudence \u00a728, at 28. There is no\nequitable principle that caps the number of parties in inter-\nest. Indeed, in taxpayer suits, a single plaintiff could get\nthe relief of \u201cannul[ling] any and every kind of tax or as-\nsessment\u201d that applied to an entire \u201ccounty, town, or city.\u201d\n\f                        Cite as: 606 U.

Instead, the ma-\njority says that single-plaintiff, nonrepresentative taxpayer suits cannot\nbe proper \u201chistorical\u201d analogues because they trace only back to the \u201cmid-\n19th century.\u201d See ibid. Yet the same is true of plaintiff-protective in-\njunctions against federal and state government officials, an equitable\nremedy the majority embraces by reference to \u201ca long line of cases au-\nthorizing suits against State officials in certain circumstances\u201d that\nrange from the cusp of the mid-19th century to the late mid-19th century.\nAnte, at 11, n. 9.

Nor is it\nclear why it matters that individual taxpayer suits occurred in state\ncourts, or that those courts did not always award the broad injunctions\navailable to them. Contra, ante, at 15. The relevant question is simply\nwhether a court of equity could award injunctive relief to nonparties.\nThe answer to that question is, obviously, yes.\n\f26                  TRUMP v.

To\nthe contrary, unlike the Court today, the English Chancery\nCourt recognized that principles of equity permit granting\nrelief to nonparties. The history of bills of peace makes that\napparent, particularly because they went beyond what Rule\n23 permits. See ante, at 13\u201314 (\u201c[T]he modern Rule 23 is in\nsome ways \u2018more restrictive of representative suits than the\noriginal bills of peace\u2019 \u201d). They are thus a common ancestor\nto both class actions and universal injunctions.\n   In any event, nothing in Rule 23 purports to supplant or\nmodify federal courts\u2019 equitable authority under the Judici-\nary Act to grant relief to nonparties, nor could it. Contra,\nante, at 14. The majority frets that universal injunctions,\nif permissible, will empower federal courts to create de facto\nclass actions at will, thereby circumventing Rule 23\u2019s pro-\ncedural protections. Ibid. Those concerns, however, have\nnot been borne out in reality. Rule 23 has coexisted with\nuniversal injunctions against the Government for decades.\nUniversal injunctions also cannot supplant the paradigm\nform of class actions, which seek money damages. In all\nevents, to the extent the majority\u2019s concern has any teeth,\nreviewing courts are already well equipped to safeguard\nRule 23\u2019s procedural protections. If there is a genuine lack\nof clarity as to the lawfulness of challenged Government ac-\ntion, district courts may well abuse their discretion by re-\nflexively issuing universal injunctions where a Rule 23\nclass action would be more appropriate. See Ashcroft v.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, 542 U.

It further contradicts this Court\u2019s practice, in cases\nlike Lewis, Pierce, and Barnette, of affirming and granting\nuniversal injunctions even when narrower, plaintiff-\nfocused injunctions would have offered complete relief to\nthe parties. See supra, at 20\u201321.

The majority offers no princi-\npled basis to deem the question resolved by a single case\nfrom 1897 while cases just a few years later charted a dif-\nferent course.

That is to be ex-\npected, given the historical support for such relief and its\nuse in bills of peace and taxpayer suits.\n   Most critically, the majority fundamentally misunder-\nstands the nature of equity by freezing in amber the precise\nremedies available at the time of the Judiciary Act. Even\nas it declares that \u201c \u2018[e]quity is flexible,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 11, the ma-\njority ignores the very flexibility that historically allowed\nequity to secure complete justice where the rigid forms of\ncommon law proved inadequate. Indeed, \u201c[i]n th[e] early\ntimes [of the common law] the chief juridical employment\nof the chancellor must have been in devising new writs, di-\nrected to the courts of common law, to give remedy in cases\nwhere none before was administered.\u201d 3 Blackstone, Com-\nmentaries on the Laws of England, at 50. Adaptability has\nthus always been at the equity\u2019s core. Hence why equity\ncourts \u201cconstantly decline[d] to lay down any rule which\nshall limit their power and discretion as to the particular\ncases, in which such injunctions shall be granted, or with-\nheld.\u201d Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence\n\u00a7959(a), at 227. The Judiciary Act of 1789 codified equity\nitself, not merely a static list of remedies.\n   Historical analogues are no doubt instructive and provide\nimportant guidance, but requiring an exact historical\nmatch for every equitable remedy defies equity\u2019s purpose.\nEquity courts understood the \u201cwisdom\u201d in keeping injunc-\ntive relief flexible, for it was \u201cimpossible to foresee all the\nexigencies of society which may require their aid and assis-\ntance to protect rights or redress wrongs.\u201d Ibid.

The later emergence of universal injunctions\nagainst the United States followed the removal of those bar-\nriers and the expansion of federal actions and laws. The\nrise of universal injunctions therefore represents equity\u2019s\nessential adaptation to modern governance.\n   It is a \u201ccommon expression . . . that Courts of Equity de-\nlight to do justice, and not by halves.\u201d Story, Commentaries\non Equity Pleadings \u00a772, at 74. The majority, however, de-\nlights to do justice by piecemeal. Its decision to strip the\nfederal courts of the authority to issue universal injunctions\nof even flagrantly unlawful Government action represents\na grave and unsupported diminution of the judicial power\nof equity.

CASA, INC.\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nHere, respondents paired their respective requests for com-\nplete relief with the strongest story possible: Without such\nrelief, an executive order that violates the Constitution, fed-\neral law, Supreme Court precedent, history, and over a cen-\ntury of Executive Branch practice would infringe upon their\nconstitutional rights or cause them to incur significant fi-\nnancial and administrative costs.\n  Perhaps that is why the majority leaves open the possi-\nbility that the District Courts, in these cases, could have\ngranted at least respondent States a nationwide injunction\nconsistent with the notion of \u201ccomplete relief.\u201d The majority\nrecognizes, correctly, that the Massachusetts District Court\n\u201cdecided that a universal injunction was necessary to pro-\nvide the States themselves with complete relief.\u201d Ante, at\n18.9 And the majority does not dispute the basis for those\ndecisions: \u201cChildren often move across state lines or are\nborn outside their parents\u2019 State of residence,\u201d and \u201cth[is]\ncross-border flow\u201d would make an injunction protecting\nonly children born in the party States \u201cunworkable.\u201d Ante,\n18. A narrower injunction would \u201crequire [the States] to\ntrack and verify the immigration status of the parents of\nevery child, along with the birth State of every child for\nwhom they provide certain federally funded benefits.\u201d Ante,\nat 18. Unrebutted record evidence bears this out and shows\nthat the Citizenship Order would irreparably harm the\nStates, even if it does not apply to children born within their\nboundaries. The Court does not contend otherwise. That\nshould be the end of the matter.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 In the majority\u2019s telling, the Washington District Court \u201cacknowl-\n\nedged the state respondents\u2019 complete relief argument but primarily\ngranted a universal injunction\u201d based on its weighing of the equities.

See ibid. What\nwould such an injunction look like, and would it be feasible?\nThe Court does not say. The majority does note, but takes\nno position on, two narrower injunctions the Government\nclaims would still give complete relief to the States: an or-\nder prohibiting the Government from enforcing the Citizen-\nship Order in respondent States, including as to state resi-\ndents born elsewhere; or an order directing the Government\nto treat children covered by the Citizenship Order as eligi-\nble for federally funded welfare benefits when those chil-\ndren reside in a respondent State. See ibid. (citing Appli-\ncation for Partial Stay of Injunction in No. 24A884, p. 23).\n   As an initial matter, the Government never raised those\nnarrower injunctions to the District Courts, meaning it for-\nfeited them. That is what the First Circuit expressly held,\n131 F. 4th, at 43 (\u201cdeclining to consider\u201d those alternatives\nbecause they were \u201craised for [the] first time . . . in support\nof stay pending appeal of preliminary injunction\u201d), and the\nmajority does not dispute the point. It is true that plaintiffs\nseeking a preliminary injunction bear the burden of making\n\u201ca clear showing that [they are] entitled to such relief.\u201d\nWinter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S.\n7, 22 (2008). The States met that burden, however: They\npresented what is still uncontroverted evidence that an in-\njunction applicable only to children born within their bor-\nders would give them less than complete relief. Accord-\ningly, it was reasonable for the District Courts to fashion\nthe remedies that they did, for they were \u201cnot obligated to\nundertake the task of chiseling from the government\u2019s\nacross-the-board [Executive Order] a different policy the\ngovernment never identified, endorsed, or defended.\u201d J.

Each would require creating a two-tiered\nscheme in which the Government\u2019s recognition of some chil-\ndren\u2019s citizenship status or eligibility for federally funded\nbenefits would change based on whether a child resides in\none of respondent States at any given moment. That\nscheme would have to operate, somehow, without imposing\nan administrative burden on respondent States or disrupt-\ning their receipt of federal funds to which they are entitled.\n\u201c[T]he regular movement of the American people into and\nout of different States . . . would make it difficult to sensibly\nmaintain such a scattershot system.\u201d Ante, at 5 (opinion of\nKAVANAUGH, J.).\n    Such a system would also be incompatible with federal\nlaw. Some statutes, like those governing Medicaid and\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) bene-\nfits, require States to give benefits only to applicants with\na Social Security number and to use those numbers for cer-\ntain administrative purposes. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a72025(e);\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71320b\u20137(a)(1). States could not comply with\nthose laws under the Government\u2019s alternative injunctions\nbecause children covered by the Citizenship Order in non-\nparty States would still be treated as noncitizens at birth.\nThus, when some of those children later move to one of re-\nspondent States, they would lack Social Security numbers.\nNo matter how it is done, discarding the nationwide status\nquo of birthright citizenship would result in chaos.\n    What is more, the principle of complete relief does not re-\nquire courts to award only the absolute narrowest injunc-\ntion possible. To conclude otherwise would eviscerate the\n\u201cdiscretion and judgment\u201d that is integral to the crafting of\ninjunctive relief. International Refugee Assistance Project,\n582 U. S., at 579.

Ante, at 16.\n   Accordingly, the District Courts appropriately deter-\nmined that the \u201conly one feasible option\u201d that would give\ncomplete relief to the States was a universal injunction.\nSee ibid. Clearly, the majority is asking the lower courts\nthemselves to explain what is patently obvious about the\nGovernment\u2019s proposed injunctions and any others that can\nbe imagined.\n   Inexplicably, however, the Court declares that, for the as-\nsociational and individual respondents, injunctions enjoin-\ning the Government from enforcing the Citizenship Order\nagainst them (and only them) would have sufficed. See\nante, at 17\u201318. In fashioning equitable relief, however,\ncourts must take into account \u201c \u2018what is workable.\u2019 \u201d North\nCarolina v. Covington, 581 U.

Just like the injunction that the majority blesses in\nthe context of its nuisance-suit hypothetical, which will be-\nstow a peaceful night upon the plaintiff \u2019s neighbors even\nwhen the plaintiff is not herself at home, the preliminary\ninjunction for the associational and individual respondents\nreflects what is practicable. As the Maryland District Court\nfound, \u201c \u2018hundreds or even thousands\u2019 \u201d of the associational\nrespondents\u2019 members, who reside in all 50 States, \u201c \u2018will\ngive birth to children in the United States over the coming\nweeks and months.\u2019 \u201d 763 F.

But see ante, at 5 (opinion of\nKAVANAUGH, J.)

Ibid. The risk of noncompliance is also\nparticularly stark here, where the challenged action itself\nreflects an utter disregard for settled precedent, and given\nthe Government\u2019s repeated insistence that it need not pro-\nvide notice to individuals before their sudden deportations.\nSee, e.g., A.

S.\n700, 714\u2013715 (2010) (plurality opinion) (\u201c \u2018[A] court must\nnever ignore . . . circumstances underlying [equitable relief]\nlest the decree be turned into an \u201cinstrument of wrong\u201d \u2019 \u201d).\n   Meanwhile, newborns subject to the Citizenship Order\nwill face the gravest harms imaginable. If the Order does\nin fact go into effect without further intervention by the Dis-\ntrict Courts, children will lose, at least for the time being,\n\u201ca most precious right,\u201d Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372\nU. S. 144, 159 (1963), and \u201ccherished status\u201d that \u201ccarries\nwith it the privilege of full participation in the affairs of our\nsociety,\u201d Knauer v. United States, 328 U. S. 654, 658 (1946).\nAffected children also risk losing the chance to participate\nin American society altogether, unless their parents have\nsufficient resources to file individual suits or successfully\nchallenge the Citizenship Order in removal proceedings.\nIndeed, the Order risks the \u201ccreation of a substantial\n\u2018shadow population\u2019 \u201d for covered children born in the\nUnited States who remain here. Plyler, 457 U. S., at 218.\nWithout Social Security numbers and other documentation,\nthese children will be denied critical public services, like\nSNAP and Medicaid, and lose the ability to engage fully in\n\f40                  TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncivic life by being born in States that have not filed a law-\nsuit. Worse yet, the Order threatens to render American-\nborn children stateless, a status \u201cdeplored in the interna-\ntional community\u201d for causing \u201cthe total destruction of the\nindividual\u2019s status in organized society.\u201d Trop v. Dulles,\n356 U. S. 86, 101\u2013102 (1958) (plurality opinion). That\nthreat hangs like a guillotine over this litigation.\n   The Order will cause chaos for the families of all affected\nchildren too, as expecting parents scramble to understand\nwhether the Order will apply to them and what ramifica-\ntions it will have. If allowed to take effect, the Order may\neven wrench newborns from the arms of parents lawfully in\nthe United States, for it purports to strip citizenship from\nthe children of parents legally present on a temporary ba-\nsis. See 90 Fed. Reg. 8449. Those newborns could face de-\nportation, even as their parents remain lawfully in the\ncountry. In light of all these consequences, there can be no\nserious question over where the equities lie in these cases.\n                              IV\n   The Court\u2019s decision is nothing less than an open invita-\ntion for the Government to bypass the Constitution. The\nExecutive Branch can now enforce policies that flout settled\nlaw and violate countless individuals\u2019 constitutional rights,\nand the federal courts will be hamstrung to stop its actions\nfully. Until the day that every affected person manages to\nbecome party to a lawsuit and secures for himself injunctive\nrelief, the Government may act lawlessly indefinitely.\n   Not even a decision from this Court would necessarily\nbind the Government to stop, completely and permanently,\nits commission of unquestionably unconstitutional conduct.\nThe majority interprets the Judiciary Act, which defines\nthe equity jurisdiction for all federal courts, this Court in-\ncluded, as prohibiting the issuance of universal injunctions\n(unless necessary for complete relief ).

So even if this Court later rules that the Cit-\nizenship Order is unlawful, we may nevertheless lack the\npower to enjoin enforcement as to anyone not formally a\nparty before the Court. In a case where the Government is\nacting in open defiance of the Constitution, federal law, and\nthis Court\u2019s holdings, it is naive to believe the Government\nwill treat this Court\u2019s opinions on those policies as \u201cde facto\u201d\nuniversal injunctions absent an express order directing to-\ntal nonenforcement. Ante, at 6 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.).\n   Indeed, at oral argument, the Government refused to\ncommit to obeying any court order issued by a Federal\nCourt of Appeals holding the Citizenship Order unlawful\n(except with respect to the plaintiffs in the suit), even\nwithin the relevant Circuit. Tr. of Oral Arg. 61\u201363. To the\nextent the Government cannot commit to compliance with\nCourt of Appeals decisions in those Circuits, it offers no\nprincipled reason why it would treat the opinions of this\nCourt any differently nationwide. Thus, by stripping even\nitself of the ability to issue universal injunctions, the Court\ndiminishes its role as \u201cthe ultimate decider of the interim\n[and permanent] legal status of major new federal statutes\nand executive actions.\u201d Ante, at 3 (opinion of KAVANAUGH,\nJ.).\n   There is a serious question, moreover, whether this Court\nwill ever get the chance to rule on the constitutionality of a\npolicy like the Citizenship Order. Contra, ante, at 6 (opin-\nion of KAVANAUGH, J.) (\u201c[T]he losing parties in the courts of\nappeals will regularly come to this Court in matters involv-\ning major new federal statutes and executive actions\u201d). In\nthe ordinary course, parties who prevail in the lower courts\ngenerally cannot seek review from this Court, likely leaving\nit up to the Government\u2019s discretion whether a petition will\n\f42                       TRUMP v.

Because respond-\nents prevailed on the merits and received universal injunc-\ntions, they have no reason to file an appeal. The Govern-\nment has no incentive to file a petition here either, because\nthe outcome of such an appeal would be preordained. The\nGovernment recognizes as much, which is why its emer-\ngency applications challenged only the scope of the prelim-\ninary injunctions.\n   Even accepting that this Court will get the opportunity to\n\u201cac[t] as the ultimate decider\u201d of patently unlawful policies,\nante, at 3 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.), and that the Execu-\ntive Branch will treat this Court\u2019s opinions as de facto uni-\nversal injunctions,11 it is still necessary for the lower courts\nto have the equitable authority to issue universal injunc-\ntions, too. As JUSTICE KAVANAUGH notes, it can take, at a\nminimum, \u201cweeks\u201d for an application concerning a major\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 On rare occasion, this Court has permitted a party who prevailed in\n\nthe lower courts nonetheless to obtain this Court\u2019s review of a legal ques-\ntion. See, e.g., Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. 692, 698 (2011) (allowing a\ngovernment official who prevailed on grounds of qualified immunity to\nchallenge an underlying adverse constitutional ruling). Those exceptions\nhave no relevance here, however, because there is no adverse determina-\ntion for respondents to challenge.\n   11 The majority insists that the constitutionality of the Citizenship Or-\n\nder will come before this Court eventually and that, when it does, the\nGovernment will obey this Court\u2019s resulting opinion with respect to all\nnewborn children. Ante, at 25, n. 18. Why? The majority is sure that\nthe Government will honor its oral-argument promises to \u201c \u2018seek cert\u2019 \u201d\nwhen it \u201c \u2018lose[s] one of \u2019 \u201d its pending appeals and to \u201crespect both the\njudgments and opinions of this Court.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg.\n50). The majority\u2019s certainty that the Government will keep its word is\nnothing short of a leap of faith, given that the Government has adopted\na plainly unconstitutional policy in defiance of this Court\u2019s precedent and\nthen gamed the system to stymie this Court\u2019s consideration of the policy\u2019s\nmerits. In any event, the Government\u2019s promise is cold comfort to the\nmany children whose parents do not file a lawsuit and whose citizenship\nstatus remains in flux pending this Court\u2019s review.\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U.

In the interim, the\nGovernment may feel free to execute illegal policies against\nnonparties and cause immeasurable harm that this Court\nmay never be able to remedy. Indeed, in these cases, there\nis a serious risk the Government will seek to deport new-\nborns whose parents have not filed suit if all the injunctions\nare narrowed on remand. That unconscionable result only\nunderscores why it is necessary, in some cases, for lower\ncourts to issue universal injunctions.\n    Fortunately, in the rubble of its assault on equity juris-\ndiction, the majority leaves untouched one important tool\nto provide broad relief to individuals subject to lawless Gov-\nernment conduct: Rule 23(b)(2) class actions for injunctive\nrelief. That mechanism may provide some relief, but it is\nnot a perfect substitute for a universal injunction. First, a\nnamed plaintiff must incur the higher cost of pursuing class\nrelief, which will involve, at a minimum, overcoming the\nhurdle of class certification. \u201c \u2018[D]emonstrating th[e] pre-\nrequisites\u2019 \u201d of numerosity, commonality and typicality and\nthe adequacy of the named plaintiff to represent the class\n\u201c \u2018is difficult and time consuming and has been getting\nharder as a result of recent court decisions and federal leg-\nislation.\u2019 \u201d Chicago v. Barr, 961 F. 3d 882, 917 (CA7 2020)\n(quoting A. Frost, In Defense of Nationwide Injunctions, 93\nN. Y. U. L. Rev. 1065, 1096 (2018); alterations in original).\n\u201c \u2018Courts have heightened the evidentiary standard for class\ncertification\u2019 \u201d as well, \u201c \u2018requiring hearings and sometimes\nsignificant amounts of evidence on the merits of the class\nbefore certifying the class.\u2019 \u201d 961 F. 3d, at 917. In recent\nyears, moreover, \u201c \u2018courts have started to deny class certifi-\ncation if they think there has been a flaw in class defini-\ntion,\u2019 \u201d sometimes \u201c \u2018without first allowing the plaintiffs to\namend that definition in response to the court\u2019s concerns.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. What is more, \u201c \u2018defendants can seek interlocutory re-\nview of a court\u2019s decision to certify a class, adding further\ndelay and expense to the certification process.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n\f44                  TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nHence why some \u201c \u2018describ[e] the class certification process\nas a \u201cdrawn-out procedural bog,\u201d which comes with signifi-\ncant expense and delay for the would be class member.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. Indeed, at oral argument, the Government refused to\nconcede that a class could be certified to challenge the Citi-\nzenship Order and promised to invoke Rule 23\u2019s barriers to\nstop it. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31\u201332.\n  Nevertheless, the parents of children covered by the Cit-\nizenship Order would be well advised to file promptly class-\naction suits and to request temporary injunctive relief for\nthe putative class pending class certification.

When the Government says \u201cdo not allow the\nlower courts to enjoin executive action universally as a rem-\nedy for unconstitutional conduct,\u201d what it is actually saying\n\f2                   TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                     JACKSON, J., dissenting\n\nis that the Executive wants to continue doing something\nthat a court has determined violates the Constitution\u2014\nplease allow this. That is some solicitation. With its ruling\ntoday, the majority largely grants the Government\u2019s wish.\nBut, in my view, if this country is going to persist as a Na-\ntion of laws and not men, the Judiciary has no choice but to\ndeny it.\n   Stated simply, what it means to have a system of govern-\nment that is bounded by law is that everyone is constrained\nby the law, no exceptions. And for that to actually happen,\ncourts must have the power to order everyone (including the\nExecutive) to follow the law\u2014full stop. To conclude other-\nwise is to endorse the creation of a zone of lawlessness\nwithin which the Executive has the prerogative to take or\nleave the law as it wishes, and where individuals who would\notherwise be entitled to the law\u2019s protection become subject\nto the Executive\u2019s whims instead.\n   The majority cannot deny that our Constitution was de-\nsigned to split the powers of a monarch between the govern-\ning branches to protect the People. Nor is it debatable that\nthe role of the Judiciary in our constitutional scheme is to\nensure fidelity to law. But these core values are strangely\nabsent from today\u2019s decision. Focusing on inapt compari-\nsons to impotent English tribunals, the majority ignores the\nJudiciary\u2019s foundational duty to uphold the Constitution\nand laws of the United States. The majority\u2019s ruling thus\nnot only diverges from first principles, it is also profoundly\ndangerous, since it gives the Executive the go-ahead to\nsometimes wield the kind of unchecked, arbitrary power the\nFounders crafted our Constitution to eradicate. The very\ninstitution our founding charter charges with the duty to\nensure universal adherence to the law now requires judges\nto shrug and turn their backs to intermittent lawlessness.\nWith deep disillusionment, I dissent.\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U.

Ante, at 6. But\nthat legalese is a smokescreen. It obscures a far more basic\nquestion of enormous legal and practical significance: May\na federal court in the United States of America order the\nExecutive to follow the law?\n                              A\n   To ask this question is to answer it. In a constitutional\nRepublic such as ours, a federal court has the power to or-\nder the Executive to follow the law\u2014and it must. It is axi-\nomatic that the Constitution of the United States and the\nstatutes that the People\u2019s representatives have enacted\ngovern in our system of government. Thus, everyone, from\nthe President on down, is bound by law. By duty and na-\nture, federal courts say what the law is (if there is a genuine\ndispute), and require those who are subject to the law to\nconform their behavior to what the law requires. This is\nthe essence of the rule of law.\n   Do not take my word for it. Venerated figures in our Na-\ntion\u2019s history have repeatedly emphasized that \u201c[t]he es-\nsence of our free Government is \u2018leave to live by no man\u2019s\nleave, underneath the law\u2019\u2014to be governed by those imper-\nsonal forces which we call law.\u201d Youngstown Sheet & Tube\nCo. v.

J. 1343, 1360\n(1988) (describing Congress\u2019s ability to \u201cregulat[e] execu-\ntive branch activities by limitations on appropriations\u201d).\nBut when the Executive violates the Constitution, the only\nrecourse is the courts. Eliminate that check, and our gov-\nernment ceases to be one of \u201climited powers.\u201d Gregory v.\nAshcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457 (1991). After all, a limit that\n\u201cdo[es] not confine the perso[n] on whom [it is] imposed\u201d is\nno limit at all. Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 176.1\n                            II\n    With that background, we can now turn to this suit and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 These foundational separation-of-powers principles are, of course, the\n\ndoctrinal underpinnings of the observations I make in Parts II and III,\ninfra. If my point is \u201cdifficult to pin down,\u201d ante, at 22, that could be due\nto the majority\u2019s myopic initial framing\u2014it casts today\u2019s emergency ap-\nplications as being solely about the scope of judicial authority, while ig-\nnoring (or forgetting) the concomitant expansion of executive power that\nresults when the equitable remedial power of judges is needlessly re-\nstricted. Or perhaps the culprit is the majority\u2019s threshold decision to\nrest its holding solely on the Judiciary Act, ante, at 5, n. 4, thereby facil-\nitating its convenient sidestepping of the startling constitutional impli-\ncations that follow from blanket limitations on the Judiciary\u2019s response\nto the Executive\u2019s lawlessness. Whatever the source of the majority\u2019s\nconfusion, there is no question that its statutory holding restricting the\ntraditional equitable power of federal courts to craft a suitable remedy\nfor established (or likely) constitutional violations has significant rami-\nfications for the separation of powers and for constitutional rights more\nbroadly. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR thoroughly explains why restricting judges\nin this manner is legally and historically unfounded. My goal is to high-\nlight the myriad ways in which the majority\u2019s newly minted no-univer-\nsal-injunctions limitation also subverts core constitutional norms and is\nfundamentally incompatible with the rule of law.\n\f                   Cite as: 606 U.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR has\nlaid out the relevant facts, see ante, at 9\u201313 (dissenting\nopinion), and I will not repeat what she has said. It suffices\nfor my purposes to reiterate that, before these applications\narrived here, three District Courts had concluded that Ex-\necutive Order No. 14160\u2014which attempts to alter the Con-\nstitution\u2019s express conferral of citizenship on all who are\nborn in this Nation, Amdt. 14, \u00a71\u2014likely violates the Con-\nstitution. Those courts each thus enjoined the Executive\nfrom enforcing that order anywhere, against anyone. See\n763 F. Supp. 3d 723 (Md. 2025), appeal pending, No. 25\u2013\n1153 (CA4); 765 F. Supp. 3d 1142 (WD Wash. 2025), appeal\npending, No. 25\u2013807 (CA9); Doe v. Trump, 766 F. Supp. 3d\n266 (Mass. 2025), appeal pending, No. 25\u20131170 (CA1).\nThree Courts of Appeals then declined to upset these in-\njunctions during the pendency of the Government\u2019s appeals.\nSee 2025 WL 654902 (CA4, Feb. 28, 2025); 2025 WL 553485\n(CA9, Feb. 19, 2025); 131 F. 4th 27 (CA1 2025).\n   The majority now does what none of the lower courts that\nhave considered Executive Order No. 14160 would do: It al-\nlows the Executive\u2019s constitutionally dubious mandate to go\ninto effect with respect to anyone who is not already a plain-\ntiff in one of the existing legal actions. Notably, the Court\nhas not determined that any of the lower courts were wrong\nabout their conclusion that the executive order likely vio-\nlates the Constitution\u2014the Executive has not asked us to\nrule on the lawfulness of Executive Order No. 14160. But\nthe majority allows the Executive to implement this order\n(which lower courts have so far uniformly declared likely\nunconstitutional) nonetheless.\n   Given the critical role of the Judiciary in maintaining the\nrule of law, see Part I, supra, it is odd, to say the least, that\nthe Court would grant the Executive\u2019s wish to be freed from\nthe constraints of law by prohibiting district courts from or-\ndering complete compliance with the Constitution. But the\n\f8                         TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                          JACKSON, J., dissenting\n\nmajority goes there. It holds that, even assuming that Ex-\necutive Order No. 14160 violates the Constitution, federal\ncourts lack the power to prevent the Executive from contin-\nuing to implement that unconstitutional directive.\n   As I understand the concern, in this clash over the respec-\ntive powers of two coordinate branches of Government, the\nmajority sees a power grab\u2014but not by a presumably law-\nless Executive choosing to act in a manner that flouts the\nplain text of the Constitution. Instead, to the majority, the\npower-hungry actors are . . . (wait for it) . . . the district\ncourts. See ante, at 1 (admonishing district courts for dar-\ning to \u201casser[t] the power\u201d to order the Executive to follow\nthe law universally). In the majority\u2019s view, federal courts\nonly have the power to \u201cafford the plaintiff complete relief \u201d\nin the cases brought before them; they can do nothing more.\nAnte, at 16. And the majority thinks a so-called universal\ninjunction\u2014that is, a court order requiring the Executive to\nfollow the law across the board and not just with respect to\nthe plaintiff\u2014\u201cgrant[s] relief to nonparties.\u201d See ante, at 6\u2013\n8. Therefore, the majority reasons, issuing such orders ex-\nceeds district courts\u2019 authority. See ante, at 21.\n   So many questions arise.2 The majority\u2019s analysis is fully\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Although I will not spend much space discussing it here, the major-\n\nity\u2019s primary premise\u2014that universal injunctions \u201cgrant relief to non-\nparties\u201d\u2014is suspect. When a court issues an injunction (universal or\notherwise), it does so via an order that governs the relationship between\nthe plaintiff and the defendant. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 65(d). That order\nprovides the plaintiff with relief: If the plaintiff believes that the defend-\nant has violated the court\u2019s order, she may come back to court, injunction\nin hand, and demand enforcement or compensation through the mecha-\nnism of civil contempt. See Longshoremen v. Philadelphia Marine Trade\nAssn., 389 U. S. 64, 75 (1967) (recognizing that an \u201cinjunction\u201d is \u201can eq-\nuitable decree compelling obedience under the threat of contempt\u201d). As\nthe majority recognizes, nonparties may benefit from an injunction a\ncourt issues in a plaintiff \u2019s case. See ante, at 16. But that does not mean\nthose incidental beneficiaries have received relief\u2014\u201cthe injunction\u2019s pro-\n\f                      Cite as: 606 U.

My objective is to expose the core conceptual fallacy\nunderlying the majority\u2019s reasoning, which, to me, also\ntends to demonstrate why, and how, today\u2019s ruling threat-\nens the rule of law.\n   The pillar upon which today\u2019s ruling rests is the major-\nity\u2019s contention that the remedial power of the federal\ncourts is limited to granting \u201ccomplete relief \u201d to the parties.\nAnte, at 15\u201316. And the majority\u2019s sole basis for that prop-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntection\u201d (i.e., the ability to seek contempt) \u201cextends only to the suing\nplaintiff.\u201d Ante, at 17.\n   An injunction prohibiting the Executive from acting unlawfully oper-\nates precisely the same way. Such an injunction may benefit nonparties\nas a practical matter\u2014but only the named plaintiffs have the right to\nreturn to the issuing court and seek contempt, if the Executive fails to\ncomply. See Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 444\u2013\n445 (1911) (\u201cProceedings for civil contempt are between the original par-\nties\u201d); Buckeye Coal & R. Co. v. Hocking Valley R. Co., 269 U. S. 42, 48\u2013\n49 (1925) (holding that a nonparty injured by the defendant\u2019s noncompli-\nance with an injunction could not enforce the injunction); cf. Blue Chip\nStamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 750 (1975) (\u201c[A] consent\ndecree is not enforceable directly or in collateral proceedings by those\nwho are not parties to it even though they were intended to be benefited\nby it\u201d). So, the majority\u2019s concern that universal injunctions inappropri-\nately grant \u201crelief \u201d to nonparties is incorrect. Nonparties may benefit\nfrom an injunction, but only the plaintiff gets relief.\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 71 is not to the contrary. Contra, ante,\nat 15, n. 11. At most, that rule and the cases the majority cites suggest\nthat, in certain narrow circumstances, a nonparty for whose benefit an\ninjunction was issued may be able to go to the issuing court and seek\ncontempt. But \u201cthe precise contours of Rule 71 . . . remain unclear,\u201d\nBeckett v. Air Line Pilots Assn., 995 F. 2d 280, 287\u2013288 (CADC 1993),\nand courts have largely recognized that, to the extent nonparty enforce-\nment of an injunction is available, the nonparty must stand in a close\nrelationship to the plaintiff or have been specifically named in the in-\njunction. See United States v. American Soc. of Composers, Authors, and\nPublishers, 341 F. 2d 1003, 1008 (CA2 1965) (nonparty could not enforce\ninjunction where it was \u201cnot . . . named in the judgment\u201d even though it\nwas \u201cindirectly or economically benefited by the decree\u201d).\n\f10                   TRUMP v.

But this cramped characterization of\nthe Judiciary\u2019s function is highly questionable when it\ncomes to suits against the Executive. That is, even if the\nmajority is correct that courts in England at the time of the\nfounding were so limited\u2014and I have my doubts, see ante,\nat 18\u201320 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting)\u2014why would courts in\nour constitutional system be limited in the same way?\n  The Founders of the United States of America squarely\nrejected a governing system in which the King ruled all, and\nall others, including the courts, were his subordinates. In\nour Constitution-centered system, the People are the rulers\nand we have the rule of law. So, it makes little sense to look\nto the relationship between English courts and the King for\nguidance on the power of our Nation\u2019s Judiciary vis-\u00e0-vis its\nExecutive. See The Federalist No. 69, at 416 (A. Hamilton)\n(explaining how the President differs from the King, includ-\ning because \u201c[t]he person of the King of Great Britain is sa-\ncred and inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to\nwhich he is amenable\u201d). Indeed, it is precisely because the\nlaw constrains the Government in our system that the Ju-\ndiciary\u2019s assignment is so broad, per the Constitution. Fed-\neral courts entertain suits against the Government claim-\ning constitutional violations. Thus, the function of the\ncourts\u2014both in theory and in practice\u2014necessarily in-\ncludes announcing what the law requires in such suits for\nthe benefit of all who are protected by the Constitution, not\nmerely doling out relief to injured private parties.\n  Put differently, the majority views the Judiciary\u2019s power\nthrough an aperture that is much too small, leading it to\nthink that the only function of our courts is to provide \u201ccom-\nplete relief \u201d to private parties. Sure, federal courts do that,\nand they do it well. But they also diligently maintain the\nrule of law itself. When it comes to upholding the law, fed-\neral courts ensure that all comers\u2014i.e., everyone to whom\n\f                      Cite as: 606 U.

Indeed, one might wonder: Why all the\nfuss? After all, the majority recognizes that district courts\ncan still issue universal injunctions in some circumstances.\nSee ante, at 16\u201318. It even acknowledges that the lower\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 No one is saying that the reasoning of a district court\u2019s opinion, on its\n\nown, \u201chas the legal force of a judgment,\u201d ante, at 22; of course it does not.\nThe real issue today\u2019s applications raise is whether district-court opin-\nions are entitled to respect while litigation over the lawfulness of the de-\nfendant\u2019s conduct is ongoing. As I have explained, the majority\u2019s key\nmove is to start by assuming that the remedial power of federal courts is\nquite narrow (i.e., it is only appropriately exercised to grant \u201ccomplete\nrelief \u201d to the parties). Ante, at 5\u201311, 16. The majority forgets (or ignores)\nthat federal courts also make pronouncements of law and issue orders\ncompelling compliance if violations are identified. Then, having zeroed\nin on solely the courts\u2019 plaintiff-specific-remedies function, the majority\nunsurprisingly insists that a district court cannot respond to the Execu-\ntive\u2019s decision to violate the law universally by issuing an order compel-\nling universal cessation of the Executive\u2019s unlawful behavior. This kind\nof broad injunction is merely one tool in a judge\u2019s kit of remedial op-\ntions\u2014one that is directly responsive to the court\u2019s duty to uphold the\nlaw and the Executive\u2019s decision to consciously violate it\u2014and it is no\nmore or less binding than any of the district court\u2019s other determinations.\nSo, rather than disdainfully securing permission to disregard the district\ncourt\u2019s opinion and continue engaging in unlawful conduct vis-\u00e0-vis any-\none who is not the plaintiff, an enjoined Executive that believes the dis-\ntrict court was wrong to conclude that its behavior is unlawful has a rule-\nof-law-affirming response at the ready: It can seek expedited review of\nthe merits on appeal. District courts themselves also have the flexibility\nto stay their injunctions pending appeal, if that is requested and the cir-\ncumstances demand it. But rather than permit lower courts to adapt\ntheir remedies to the particulars of a given case, the majority today ties\njudges\u2019 hands, requiring them to acquiesce to executive lawlessness in\nevery situation.\n\f12                   TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                     JACKSON, J., dissenting\n\ncourts may reimpose the same universal injunctions at is-\nsue in these cases, if the courts find on remand that doing\nso is necessary to provide complete relief to the named\nplaintiffs. See ante, at 19. From the standpoint of out-\ncomes, that\u2019s all welcome news. But, as I explain below,\nfrom the perspective of constitutional theory and actual\npractice, disaster looms.\n  What I mean by this is that our rights-based legal system\ncan only function properly if the Executive, and everyone\nelse, is always bound by law. Today\u2019s decision is a seismic\nshock to that foundational norm. Allowing the Executive to\nviolate the law at its prerogative with respect to anyone\nwho has not yet sued carves out a huge exception\u2014a gash\nin the basic tenets of our founding charter that could turn\nout to be a mortal wound. What is more, to me, requiring\ncourts themselves to provide the dagger (by giving their im-\nprimatur to the Executive Branch\u2019s intermittent lawless-\nness) makes a mockery of the Judiciary\u2019s solemn duty to\nsafeguard the rule of law.\n                               A\n  Do remember: The Executive has not asked this Court to\ndetermine whether Executive Order No. 14160 complies\nwith the Constitution. Rather, it has come to us seeking\nthe right to continue enforcing that order regardless\u2014i.e.,\neven though six courts have now said the order is likely un-\nconstitutional. What the Executive wants, in effect, is for\nthis Court to bless and facilitate its desire to operate in two\ndifferent zones moving forward: one in which it is required\nto follow the law (because a particular plaintiff has secured\na personal injunction prohibiting its unlawful conduct), and\nanother in which it can choose to violate the law with re-\nspect to certain people (those who have yet to sue).\n  In the first zone, law reigns. For the named plaintiffs in\nthe suits before us, for example, the lower courts\u2019 determi-\n\f                      Cite as: 606 U.

Per the courts\u2019\norders, the Executive is prohibited from denying citizenship\nto the offspring of the named plaintiffs. See ante, at 26\n(leaving the injunctions in place to the extent \u201cnecessary to\nprovide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to\nsue\u201d). Within this zone, the courts\u2019 rule of decision\u2014that\nExecutive Order No. 14160 is likely unconstitutional\u2014ap-\nplies.\n   But with its ruling today, the majority endorses the crea-\ntion of a second zone\u2014one in which that rule of decision has\nno effect. In this zone, which is populated by those who lack\nthe wherewithal or ability to go to court, all bets are off.\nThere is no court-issued mandate requiring the Executive\nto honor birthright citizenship in compliance with the Con-\nstitution, so the people within this zone are left to the pre-\nrogatives of the Executive as to whether their constitutional\nrights will be respected. It does not matter what six federal\ncourts have said about Executive Order No. 14160; those\ncourts are powerless to make the Executive stop enforcing\nthat order altogether. In effect, then, that powerlessness\ncreates a void that renders the Constitution\u2019s constraints\nirrelevant to the Executive\u2019s actions. Of course, the Execu-\ntive might choose to follow the law in this zone as well\u2014but\nthat is left to its discretion. And the Solicitor General has\nnow confirmed that, in the absence of a personal injunction\nsecured by a particular plaintiff, this Executive\u2019s view is\nthat compliance with lower court rulings on matters of con-\nstitutional significance is optional.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The Solicitor General said that quiet part out loud by baldly asserting\n\nthat the Executive reserves the right to defy Circuit precedent. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 33\u201334, 60\u201361. Although he further suggested that the admin-\nistration would abide by precedent from this Court in future similar\ncases, id., at 35, 63, even that seems to be a matter of prerogative, as\nthere is no inherent limit to the limited-scope-of-authority logic that un-\nderlies today\u2019s holding, see ante, at 41 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).

CASA, INC.\n\n                          JACKSON, J., dissenting\n\n   I am not the first to observe that a legal system that op-\nerates on two different tracks (one of which grants to the\nExecutive the prerogative to disregard the law) is anath-\nema to the rule of law.5 Thus, the law-free zone that results\nfrom this Court\u2019s near elimination of universal injunctions\nis not an unfamiliar archetype. Also eerily echoing history\u2019s\nhorrors is the fact that today\u2019s prerogative zone is unlikely\nto impact the public in a randomly distributed manner.\nThose in the good graces of the Executive have nothing to\nfear; the new prerogative that the Executive has to act un-\nlawfully will not be exercised with respect to them. Those\nwho accede to the Executive\u2019s demands, too, will be in the\nclear. The wealthy and the well connected will have little\ndifficulty securing legal representation, going to court, and\nobtaining injunctive relief in their own name if the Execu-\ntive violates their rights.\n   Consequently, the zone of lawlessness the majority has\nnow authorized will disproportionately impact the poor, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nExecutive\u2019s less-than-sterling record of compliance with Supreme Court\nrulings to date casts further doubt on this compliance claim; as JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR has explained, the Executive Order at issue here seems to\nsquarely violate at least one\u2014and perhaps five\u2014of our bedrock prece-\ndents.

But the\nmajority seems to forget (or ignores) that the Constitution\nand Congress also limit the power of the Executive. In ad-\ndition, it is indisputable that the Executive\u2019s power to lev-\nerage physical force in a manner that directly threatens to\ndeprive people of life, liberty, or property creates uniquely\nharmful risks when unconstrained by law. But the majority\ntoday roots its holding in a purported statutory limitation,\nnot a constitutional one. Ante, at 5, n. 4. And, as I have\nexplained, our Constitution gives federal courts the author-\nity to order the Executive to stop acting unlawfully. See\nPart I, supra. To the extent Congress has attempted to\nstrip federal courts of that power via the Judiciary Act (and,\nto be clear, I do not think it has, for the reasons JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR discusses, see ante, at 23\u201331), it is powerless\nto do so.\n   The bottom line is this: If courts do not have the authority\nto require the Executive to adhere to law universally, a\ndual-track system develops in which courts are ousted as\nguardians in some situations and compliance with law\nsometimes becomes a matter of executive prerogative.

Yes,\ncertain named plaintiffs have brought particular lawsuits\nseeking protection of their legal rights. But their claim is\nthat Executive Order No. 14160 violates the Constitution.\nIf the court agrees with them, why on Earth must it permit\nthat unconstitutional government action to take effect at\nall?\n   I have already explained why the majority\u2019s answer\u2014be-\ncause the court is powerless to do anything but give \u201ccom-\nplete relief \u201d to those parties\u2014is wrong in terms of the ac-\ntual scope of federal courts\u2019 authority. See Part I, supra. I\nnow observe that this response also erroneously suggests\nthat a court does something wrongful when it imposes a\nuniversal injunction in a single plaintiff \u2019s lawsuit\u2014akin to\ngiving a windfall to those who do not deserve the law\u2019s pro-\ntection because they have not sued. Ante, at 8\u20139, 12\u201315.\nThis way of conceptualizing universal injunctions mistakes\nthat remedy for the unearned spoils of particular adversar-\nial engagements, rather than a necessary tool employed to\ndefend the Constitution by reinforcing pre-existing rights.\n   Here is what I mean. Our Constitution indisputably con-\n\f                     Cite as: 606 U.

See n. 2, supra. Rather, the very\nconcept of constitutional rights makes the People intended beneficiaries\nof the constraints that the Constitution imposes on executive action.\n   8 Again, the law binds the Executive from the outset in our constitu-\n\ntional scheme, for the benefit of all. See Part I, supra. Thus, a lawsuit\nis merely the vehicle that invokes the Judiciary\u2019s power to check the Ex-\necutive by enforcing the law. The topsy-turvy scheme the majority cre-\nates today gets those well-established norms exactly backward: The law\ndisappears as an initial constraint on the Executive, and apparently only\n\f18                       TRUMP v.

Imagine an Executive who is-\nsues a blanket order that is blatantly unconstitutional\u2014de-\nmanding, say, that any and all of its political foes be sum-\nmarily and indefinitely incarcerated in a prison outside the\njurisdiction of the United States, without any hearing or\nchance to be heard in court. Shortly after learning of this\nedict, one such political rival rushes into court with his law-\nyer, claims the Executive\u2019s order violates the Constitution,\nand secures an injunction that prohibits the Executive from\nenforcing that unconstitutional mandate. The upshot of to-\nday\u2019s decision is that, despite that rival\u2019s success in per-\nsuading a judge of the unconstitutional nature of the Exec-\nutive\u2019s proclamation, the court\u2019s ruling and injunction can\nonly require the Executive to shelve any no-process incar-\nceration plan that targets that particular individual (the\nnamed plaintiff ); the Executive can keep right on rounding\nup its other foes, despite the court\u2019s clear and unequivocal\npronouncement that the executive order is unlawful.\n   The majority today says that, unless and until the other\npolitical rivals seek and secure their own personal injunc-\ntions, the Executive can carry on acting unconstitutionally\nwith respect to each of them, as if the Constitution\u2019s due\nprocess requirement does not exist. For those who get to\ncourt in time, their right not to be indefinitely imprisoned\nwithout due process will be protected. But if they are una-\nble to sue or get to the courthouse too late, the majority\nsays, oh well, there is nothing to be done, despite the fact\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nexists if a particular plaintiff files a particular lawsuit in a particular\ncourt, claiming his (particular) entitlement.\n\f                     Cite as: 606 U.

But, after to-\nday, that is where we are. What the majority has done is\nallow the Executive to nullify the statutory and constitu-\ntional rights of the uncounseled, the underresourced, and\nthe unwary, by prohibiting the lower courts from ordering\nthe Executive to follow the law across the board. Moreover,\nofficers who have sworn an oath to uphold the law are now\nrequired to allow the Executive to blatantly violate it. Fed-\neral judges pledge to support and defend the Constitution\nof the United States against all enemies, foreign or domes-\ntic. 5 U. S. C. \u00a73331. They do not agree to permit unconsti-\ntutional behavior by the Executive (or anyone else). But the\nmajority forgets (or ignores) this duty, eagerly imposing a\nlimit on the power of courts that, in essence, prevents\njudges from doing what their oaths require.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The majority highlights a number of policy concerns that some say\n\nwarrant restriction of the universal-injunction remedy. Ante, at 20\u201321.\nIn my view, those downsides pale in comparison to the consequences of\nforcing federal courts to acquiesce to executive lawlessness. Moreover,\nand in any event, the various practical problems critics have identified\nare largely overblown. For example, while many accuse universal in-\njunctions of preventing percolation, the facts of this very suit demon-\nstrate otherwise: Three different District Courts each considered the\nmerits of Executive Order No. 14160, and appeals are now pending in\n\f20                        TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                          JACKSON, J., dissenting\n\n   I view the demise of the notion that a federal judge can\norder the Executive to adhere to the Constitution\u2014full\nstop\u2014as a sad day for America. The majority\u2019s unpersua-\nsive effort to justify this result makes it sadder still. It is\nthe responsibility of each and every jurist to hold the line.\nBut the Court now requires judges to look the other way\nafter finding that the Executive is violating the law, shame-\nfully permitting unlawful conduct to continue unabated.\n   Today\u2019s ruling thus surreptitiously stymies the Judici-\nary\u2019s core duty to protect and defend constitutional rights.\nIt does this indirectly, by preventing lower courts from tell-\ning the Executive that it has to stop engaging in conduct\nthat violates the Constitution. Instead, now, a court\u2019s\npower to prevent constitutional violations comes with an\nasterisk\u2014a court can make the Executive cease its uncon-\nstitutional conduct *but only with respect to the particular\nplaintiffs named in the lawsuit before them, leaving the Ex-\necutive free to violate the constitutional rights of anyone\nand everyone else.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthree Courts of Appeals. See supra, at 7. Other prudential concerns are\nbetter addressed in more targeted ways, such as by changing venue rules\nto prevent forum or judge shopping, or by encouraging lower courts to\nexpedite their review, thereby teeing the merits up for this Court as\nquickly as possible.\n   That is not to say that universal injunctions can or should be issued in\nevery case; a court must always fit its remedy to the particular case be-\nfore it, and those particulars may caution against issuing universal relief\nin certain instances. See ante, at 22\u201323 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). But\nthe Court today for the first time ever adopts a blanket authority-dimin-\nishing rule: It declares that courts do not have the power to exercise their\nequitable discretion to order the Executive to completely cease acting\npursuant to an unlawful directive (unless doing so is necessary to provide\ncomplete relief to a given plaintiff ). And, again, this very suit illustrates\nwhy that bright line rule goes much too far. As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR em-\nphasizes, multiple courts have recognized that Executive Order No.\n14160 is \u201cpatently unconstitutional under settled law,\u201d and those courts\nthus issued the relief necessary to \u201cprotect newborns from the excep-\ntional, irreparable harm associated with losing a foundational constitu-\ntional right and its immediate benefits.\u201d Ibid.\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U.

This perverse burden shifting cannot co-\nexist with the rule of law. In essence, the Court has now\nshoved lower court judges out of the way in cases where ex-\necutive action is challenged, and has gifted the Executive\nwith the prerogative of sometimes disregarding the law. As\na result, the Judiciary\u2014the one institution that is solely re-\nsponsible for ensuring our Republic endures as a Nation of\nlaws\u2014has put both our legal system, and our system of gov-\nernment, in grave jeopardy.\n   \u201cThe accretion of dangerous power does not come in a\nday.\u201d Youngstown, 343 U.

By\nneedlessly granting the Government\u2019s emergency applica-\ntion to prohibit universal injunctions, the Court has cleared\na path for the Executive to choose law-free action at this\nperilous moment for our Constitution\u2014right when the Ju-\ndiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve\nthe law\u2019s constraints. I have no doubt that, if judges must\nallow the Executive to act unlawfully in some circum-\nstances, as the Court concludes today, executive lawless-\nness will flourish, and from there, it is not difficult to pre-\ndict how this all ends. Eventually, executive power will\nbecome completely uncontainable, and our beloved consti-\ntutional Republic will be no more.\n   Perhaps the degradation of our rule-of-law regime would\nhappen anyway. But this Court\u2019s complicity in the creation\nof a culture of disdain for lower courts, their rulings, and\nthe law (as they interpret it) will surely hasten the downfall\n\f22                    TRUMP v.

So, they insist, universal injunctions must be\npermitted for the good of the system.\n   The Government advances policy arguments running the\nother way. Echoing Chief Judge Sutton, the Government\nasserts that avoiding a patchwork enforcement system is a\njustification that \u201clacks a limiting principle and would\nmake nationwide injunctions the rule rather than the ex-\nception\u201d for challenges to many kinds of federal law. Ari-\nzona, 40 F. 4th, at 397 (concurring opinion). It stresses\u2014as\nthe principal dissent also observes\u2014that universal injunc-\ntions incentivize forum shopping, since a successful chal-\nlenge in one jurisdiction entails relief nationwide. See Ap-\nplication in No. 24A884, at 19\u201320; see also post, at 22\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). In a similar vein, the Govern-\nment observes that universal injunctions operate asymmet-\nrically: A plaintiff must win just one suit to secure sweeping\nrelief. But to fend off such an injunction, the Government\nmust win everywhere. See Application in No. 24A884,\nat 19\u201320; see also post, at 22\u201323 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.)\n(acknowledging this concern).15 Moreover, the Government\ncontends, the practice of universal injunctions means that\nhighly consequential cases are often decided in a \u201cfast\nand furious\u201d process of \u201c \u2018rushed, high-stakes, [and] low-\ninformation\u2019 \u201d decisionmaking. Labrador, 601 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 12) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in grant of stay).\nWhen a district court issues a universal injunction, thereby\nhalting the enforcement of federal policy, the Government\nsays that it has little recourse but to proceed to the court of\nappeals for an emergency stay. The loser in the court of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 The Government contrasts this with class actions. A judgment in a\n\nRule 23 class action (favorable or not) binds the whole class\u2014so if the\ndefendant wins, it is protected from future suits. But because an adverse\nruling on a request for universal relief lacks this preclusive effect, plain-\ntiffs can continue to file in different forums until they find a court willing\nto award such relief.\n\f                      Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

Nothing like a universal injunction was avail-\nable at the founding, or for that matter, for more than a\ncentury thereafter.

This concession,\nwhile welcome, is inconsistent with the position that the universal in-\njunction is a \u201cnothing to see here\u201d extension of the kind of decree obtained\non a bill of peace. Neither the principal dissent nor respondents have\npointed to any evidence that such decrees presented any of the universal\ninjunction\u2019s systemic problems or that they were reserved for situations\nin which the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cpatently unconstitutional\u201d and\nrisked \u201cexceptional\u201d harm.

And, she\nwarns, if courts lack the power to \u201crequire the Executive to\nadhere to law universally,\u201d post, at 15, courts will leave a\n\u201cgash in the basic tenets of our founding charter that could\nturn out to be a mortal wound,\u201d post, at 12.\n   Rhetoric aside, JUSTICE JACKSON\u2019s position is difficult to\npin down. She might be arguing that universal injunctions\nare appropriate\u2014even required\u2014whenever the defendant\nis part of the Executive Branch. See, e.g., post, at 3, 10\u201312,\n16\u201318.

But the Judiciary does not have unbridled author-\nity to enforce this obligation\u2014in fact, sometimes the law\nprohibits the Judiciary from doing so.

But see post, at 15 (JACKSON, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf\ncourts do not have the authority to require the Executive to\nadhere to law universally, . . . compliance with law some-\ntimes becomes a matter of Executive prerogative\u201d). Observ-\ning the limits on judicial authority\u2014including, as relevant\nhere, the boundaries of the Judiciary Act of 1789\u2014is re-\nquired by a judge\u2019s oath to follow the law.\n   JUSTICE JACKSON skips over that part. Because analyz-\ning the governing statute involves boring \u201clegalese,\u201d post, at\n3, she seeks to answer \u201ca far more basic question of enor-\nmous practical significance: May a federal court in the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 Think about what this position means. If a judge in the District of\n\nAlaska holds that a criminal statute is unconstitutional, can the United\nStates prosecute a defendant under that statute in the District of Mary-\nland? Perhaps JUSTICE JACKSON would instinctively say yes; it is hard to\nimagine anyone saying no. But why, on JUSTICE JACKSON\u2019s logic, does it\nnot violate the rule of law for the Executive to initiate a prosecution else-\nwhere? See post, at 2 (dissenting opinion). Among its many problems,\nJUSTICE JACKSON\u2019s view is at odds with our system of divided judicial au-\nthority. See, e.g., this Court\u2019s Rule 10(a) (identifying conflict in the deci-\nsions of the courts of appeals as grounds for granting certiorari). It is\nalso in considerable tension with the reality that district court opinions\nlack precedential force even vis-\u00e0-vis other judges in the same judicial\ndistrict. See Camreta v.

I agree and join in full. As\nthe Court explains, the Judiciary Act of 1789\u2014the statute\nthat \u201c \u2018authorizes the federal courts to issue equitable rem-\nedies\u2019 \u201d\u2014does not permit universal injunctions. Ante, at 5.\nIt authorizes only those remedies traditionally available in\nequity, and there is no historical tradition allowing courts\nto provide \u201crelief that extend[s] beyond the parties.\u201d Ante,\nat 5\u201311. That conclusion is dispositive: As I have previously\nexplained, \u201c[i]f district courts have any authority to issue\n\f2                    TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nuniversal injunctions,\u201d it must come from some specific\nstatutory or constitutional grant. Trump v.

Otherwise,\nthey risk replicating the problems of universal injunctions\nunder the guise of granting complete relief.\n   As the Court recognizes, the complete-relief principle op-\nerates as a ceiling: In no circumstance can a court award\nrelief beyond that necessary to redress the plaintiffs\u2019 inju-\nries. See ante, at 18 (\u201cComplete relief is not a guarantee\u2014\nit is the maximum a court can provide\u201d). This limitation\nfollows from both Article III and traditional equitable prac-\ntice. Because Article III limits courts to resolving specific\n\u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies,\u201d see U. S. Const., Art. III, \u00a72, it\nrequires that any remedy \u201cbe tailored to redress the plain-\ntiff \u2019s particular injury.\u201d Gill v. Whitford, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">585 U.

That will have the salutary effect of bringing an end to\nthe practice of runaway \u201cuniversal\u201d injunctions, but it\nleaves other questions unanswered. Perhaps most im-\nportant, when a State brings a suit to vindicate the rights\nof individual residents and then procures injunctive relief,\ndoes the injunction bind the defendant with respect to all\nresidents of that State? If so, States will have every incen-\ntive to bring third-party suits on behalf of their residents to\nobtain a broader scope of equitable relief than any individ-\nual resident could procure in his own suit.

Most significantly, district courts can no longer\naward preliminary nationwide or classwide relief except\nwhen such relief is legally authorized. And that salutary\ndevelopment will help bring substantially more order and\ndiscipline to the ubiquitous preliminary litigation over new\nfederal statutes and executive actions.\n   I write separately simply to underscore that this case\nfocuses on only one discrete aspect of the preliminary\nlitigation relating to major new federal statutes and\nexecutive actions\u2014namely, what district courts may do\nwith respect to those new statutes and executive actions in\nwhat might be called \u201cthe interim before the interim.\u201d\nAlthough district courts have received much of the\nattention (and criticism) in debates over the universal-\ninjunction issue, those courts generally do not have the last\nword when they grant or deny preliminary injunctions.

In justiciable cases, this Court, not the district\ncourts or courts of appeals, will often still be the ultimate\ndecisionmaker as to the interim legal status of major new\nfederal statutes and executive actions\u2014that is, the interim\nlegal status for the several-year period before a final\ndecision on the merits.\n                             I\n  The Court\u2019s decision today focuses on the \u201cinterim before\nthe interim\u201d\u2014the preliminary relief that district courts can\naward (and courts of appeals can approve) for the generally\nweeks-long interim before this Court can assess and settle\nthe matter for the often years-long interim before a final\ndecision on the merits. To appreciate the broader context\nsurrounding today\u2019s decision, it is important to understand\n\f4                    TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nthis Court\u2019s role in preliminary litigation of this sort.\n    The basic scenario in these kinds of applications to this\nCourt is by now familiar. Congress passes a major new\nstatute, or the Executive Branch issues a major new rule or\nexecutive order. The litigation over the legality of the new\nstatute or executive action winds its way through the\nfederal courts. And that litigation may meander on for\nmany months or often years before this Court can issue a\nfinal ruling deciding the legality of the new statute or\nexecutive action.\n    In the meantime, various plaintiffs may seek preliminary\ninjunctions, sometimes in many different district courts.\nAnd a government defendant against whom a preliminary\ninjunction is granted (or a plaintiff who is denied a\npreliminary injunction) may seek a temporary stay or\ninjunction in the court of appeals and then in this Court.\n    That preliminary-injunction litigation\u2014which typically\ntakes place at a rapid-fire pace long before the merits\nlitigation culminates several years down the road\u2014raises a\nquestion: What should the interim legal status of the\nsignificant new federal statute or executive action at issue\nbe during the several-year period before this Court\u2019s final\nruling on the merits?\n    That interim-status question is itself immensely\nimportant. The issue of whether a major new federal\nstatute or executive action \u201cis enforceable during the\nseveral years while the parties wait for a final merits ruling\n. . . raises a separate question of extraordinary significance\nto the parties and the American people.\u201d Labrador v. Poe,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">601 U. S. ___</span><pre class=\"inline\">, ___\u2013___ (2024) (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nin grant of stay) (slip op., at 2\u20133).\n    The interim-status issue in turn raises two other critical\nquestions: Should there be a nationally uniform answer on\nthe question of whether a major new federal statute or\nexecutive action can be legally enforced in the often years-\nlong interim period until this Court reaches a final decision\n\f                  Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U. S. ____</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2025)            5\n\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\non the merits? If so, who decides what the nationally\nuniform interim answer is?\n  First, in my view, there often (perhaps not always, but\noften) should be a nationally uniform answer on whether a\nmajor new federal statute, rule, or executive order can be\nenforced throughout the United States during the several-\nyear interim period until its legality is finally decided on\nthe merits.\n  Consider just a few of the major executive actions that\nhave been the subject of intense preliminary-injunction or\nother pre-enforcement litigation in the past 10 years or so,\nunder Presidents of both political parties. They range from\ntravel bans to birthright citizenship, from the Clean Power\nPlan to student loan forgiveness, from the OSHA vaccine\nmandate to the service of transgender individuals in the\nmilitary, from Title IX regulations to abortion drugs. And\nthe list goes on. Those executive actions often are highly\nsignificant and have widespread effects on many\nindividuals,    businesses,     governments,     and     other\norganizations throughout the United States.\n  Often, it is not especially workable or sustainable or\ndesirable to have a patchwork scheme, potentially for\nseveral years, in which a major new federal statute or\nexecutive action of that kind applies to some people or\norganizations in certain States or regions, but not to others.\nThe national reach of many businesses and government\nprograms, as well as the regular movement of the American\npeople into and out of different States and regions, would\nmake it difficult to sensibly maintain such a scattershot\nsystem of federal law.\n  Second, if one agrees that the years-long interim status\nof a highly significant new federal statute or executive\naction should often be uniform throughout the United\nStates, who decides what the interim status is?\n  The answer typically will be this Court, as has been the\ncase both traditionally and recently. This Court\u2019s actions\n\f6                       TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                      KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nin resolving applications for interim relief help provide\nclarity and uniformity as to the interim legal status of\nmajor new federal statutes, rules, and executive orders. In\nparticular, the Court\u2019s disposition of applications for\ninterim relief often will effectively settle, de jure or de facto,\nthe interim legal status of those statutes or executive\nactions nationwide.\n   The decision today will not alter this Court\u2019s traditional\nrole in those matters. Going forward, in the wake of a major\nnew federal statute or executive action, different district\ncourts may enter a slew of preliminary rulings on the\nlegality of that statute or executive action.                  Or\nalternatively, perhaps a district court (or courts) will grant\nor deny the functional equivalent of a universal\ninjunction\u2014for example, by granting or denying a\npreliminary injunction to a putative nationwide class under\nRule 23(b)(2), or by preliminarily setting aside or declining\nto set aside an agency rule under the APA.\n   No matter how the preliminary-injunction litigation on\nthose kinds of significant matters transpires in the district\ncourts, the courts of appeals in turn will undoubtedly be\ncalled upon to promptly grant or deny temporary stays or\ntemporary injunctions in many cases.\n   And regardless of whether the district courts have issued\na series of individual preliminary rulings, or instead have\nissued one or more broader classwide or set-aside\npreliminary rulings, the losing parties in the courts of\nappeals will regularly come to this Court in matters\ninvolving major new federal statutes and executive\nactions.2\n   If there is no classwide or set-aside relief in those kinds\nof nationally significant matters, then one would expect a\nflood of decisions from lower courts, after which the losing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 By statute, some litigation may start in a court of appeals or three-\n\njudge district court and then come directly to this Court.\n\f                      Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

When\nwe receive such an application, we must grant or deny.4\nAnd when we do\u2014that is, when this Court makes a decision\non the interim legal status of a major new federal statute or\nexecutive action\u2014that decision will often constitute a form\nof precedent (de jure or de facto) that provides guidance\nthroughout the United States during the years-long interim\nperiod until a final decision on the merits.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 That scenario explains why it would not make much sense for this\n\nCourt to apply different standards to (i) an application for an injunction\nand (ii) an application for a stay of an injunction. See, e.g., Tandon v.\nNewsom, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">593 U. S. 61</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 (2021) (per curiam) (applying the usual stay\nstandard to an application for an injunction).\n   Suppose a district court in Circuit A enjoins a new executive action.\nAnd the court of appeals in Circuit A then declines to stay the injunction.\nMeanwhile, a district court in Circuit B does not enjoin that new\nexecutive action, and the court of appeals in Circuit B also declines to\nenjoin it. Both cases come to this Court on applications for interim\nrelief\u2014one seeking a stay of injunction and one seeking an injunction. It\nwould not be particularly rational to deny a stay and leave the injunction\nin place in Circuit A, and then to turn around and deny an injunction in\nCircuit B on account of a purportedly higher standard for this Court to\ngrant injunctions rather than stays. The standards should mesh so that\nthis Court can ensure uniformity without regard to the happenstance of\nhow various courts of appeals and district courts ruled.\n   4 To obtain an interim stay or injunction, \u201can applicant must show (1) a\n\nreasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue\nsufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari; (2) a fair prospect that a\nmajority of the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below; and (3) a\nlikelihood that irreparable harm will result from the denial\u201d of the\napplication.

That suggestion is flawed, in my view, because it\nwould often leave an unworkable or intolerable patchwork\nof federal law in place. And even in cases where there is no\npatchwork\u2014for example, because an application comes to\nus with a single nationwide class-action injunction\u2014what\nif this Court thinks the lower court\u2019s decision is wrong? On\nstudent loan forgiveness or the Clean Power Plan or\nmifepristone or the travel bans, for example? Should we\nhave a rule of presumptively denying relief, thereby\nallowing erroneous injunctions (or erroneous denials of\ninjunctions) of major new statutes and executive actions to\nremain in place for several years, and thus severely\nharming the Government and would-be beneficiaries of (or\nregulated parties under) those new statutes and executive\nactions? I think not. And this Court\u2019s actions over the years\nreflect that the Court thinks not.\n   Unless and until this Court grants or denies an\napplication for stay or injunction, tremendous uncertainty\nmay surround the interim legal status of the new federal\nstatute or executive action throughout the country. The\nstatute or executive action may be in effect in some places\nbut not others, for some businesses but not others, for some\nAmericans but not others. That temporary geographic,\norganizational, and individual variation in federal law\nmight not warrant this Court\u2019s intervention in run-of-the-\nmill cases\u2014which is why it makes sense that this Court\ndenies applications for interim relief when the Court is\nunlikely to later grant certiorari.

In those\nkinds of cases, disuniformity\u2014even if only for a few years\nor less\u2014can be chaotic. And such chaos is not good for the\nlaw or the country.\n   One of this Court\u2019s roles, in justiciable cases, is to resolve\nmajor legal questions of national importance and ensure\nuniformity of federal law. So a default policy of off-loading\nto lower courts the final word on whether to green-light or\nblock major new federal statutes and executive actions for\nthe several-year interim until a final ruling on the merits\nwould seem to amount to an abdication of this Court\u2019s\nproper role.\n   Some might object that this Court is not well equipped to\nmake those significant decisions\u2014namely, decisions about\nthe interim status of a major new federal statute or\nexecutive action\u2014on an expedited basis. But district courts\nand courts of appeals are likewise not perfectly equipped to\nmake expedited preliminary judgments on important\nmatters of this kind. Yet they have to do so, and so do we.\nBy law, federal courts are open and can receive and review\napplications for relief 24/7/365. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U. S. C. \u00a7452</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (\u201cAll\ncourts of the United States shall be deemed always open for\nthe purpose of filing proper papers . . . and making motions\nand orders\u201d). And this Court has procedural tools that can\nhelp us make the best possible interim decision in the\nlimited time available\u2014administrative stays, additional\nbriefing, amicus briefs, oral argument, certiorari before\njudgment, and the like. On top of that, this Court has nine\nJustices, each of whom can (and does) consult and\ndeliberate with the other eight to help the Court determine\nthe best answer, unlike a smaller three-judge court of\nappeals panel or one-judge district court. And this Court\nalso will have the benefit of the prior decisions in the case\nat hand from the court of appeals and the district court.\n   Some might argue that preliminary disputes over the\n\f10                  TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nlegality of major new statutes and executive actions can\ndraw this Court into difficult or controversial matters\nearlier than we might like, as distinct from what happens\non our slower-moving merits docket.              That is an\nunderstandable concern. But when it comes to the interim\nstatus of major new federal statutes and executive actions,\nit is often important for reasons of clarity, stability, and\nuniformity that this Court be the decider. And Members of\nthe Court have life tenure so that we can make tough calls\nwithout fear or favor. As with the merits docket, the Court\u2019s\nrole in resolving applications for interim relief is to\nneutrally referee each matter based on the relevant legal\nstandard. Avoiding controversial or difficult decisions on\nthose applications is neither feasible nor appropriate.\n   Some might also worry that an early or rushed decision\non an application could \u201clock in\u201d the Court\u2019s assessment of\nthe merits and subtly deter the Court from later making a\ndifferent final decision. But in deciding applications for\ninterim relief involving major new statutes or executive\nactions, we often have no choice but to make a preliminary\nassessment of likelihood of success on the merits; after all,\nin cases of that sort, the other relevant factors (irreparable\nharm and the equities) are often very weighty on both sides.\nSee Labrador v.

There it has remained, accepted and re-\nspected by Congress, by the Executive, and by this Court.\nUntil today.\n   It is now the President who attempts, in an Executive Or-\nder (Order or Citizenship Order), to repudiate birthright\ncitizenship. Every court to evaluate the Order has deemed\nit patently unconstitutional and, for that reason, has en-\njoined the Federal Government from enforcing it. Unde-\nterred, the Government now asks this Court to grant emer-\ngency relief, insisting it will suffer irreparable harm unless\nit can deprive at least some children born in the United\nStates of citizenship. See Protecting the Meaning and\nValue of American Citizenship, Exec. Order No. 14160, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">90\nFed. Reg. 8849</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2025).\n   The Government does not ask for complete stays of the\ninjunctions, as it ordinarily does before this Court. Why?\nThe answer is obvious: To get such relief, the Government\nwould have to show that the Order is likely constitutional,\nan impossible task in light of the Constitution\u2019s text, his-\ntory, this Court\u2019s precedents, federal law, and Executive\nBranch practice. So the Government instead tries its hand\nat a different game. It asks this Court to hold that, no mat-\nter how illegal a law or policy, courts can never simply tell\nthe Executive to stop enforcing it against anyone. Instead,\nthe Government says, it should be able to apply the Citizen-\nship Order (whose legality it does not defend) to everyone\nexcept the plaintiffs who filed this lawsuit.\n   The gamesmanship in this request is apparent and the\nGovernment makes no attempt to hide it. Yet, shamefully,\nthis Court plays along. A majority of this Court decides that\nthese applications, of all cases, provide the appropriate oc-\ncasion to resolve the question of universal injunctions and\nend the centuries-old practice once and for all. In its rush\nto do so the Court disregards basic principles of equity as\nwell as the long history of injunctive relief granted to non-\nparties.\n\f                  Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

Tomorrow, a\ndifferent administration may try to seize firearms from law-\nabiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from\ngathering to worship. The majority holds that, absent cum-\nbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely\nenjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so\nis necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief.\nThat holding renders constitutional guarantees meaningful\nin name only for any individuals who are not parties to a\nlawsuit. Because I will not be complicit in so grave an at-\ntack on our system of law, I dissent.\n                              I\n   The majority ignores entirely whether the President\u2019s Ex-\necutive Order is constitutional, instead focusing only on the\nquestion whether federal courts have the equitable author-\nity to issue universal injunctions. Yet the Order\u2019s patent\nunlawfulness reveals the gravity of the majority\u2019s error and\nunderscores why equity supports universal injunctions as\nappropriate remedies in this kind of case. As every conceiv-\nable source of law confirms, birthright citizenship is the law\nof the land.\n                               A\n  The Citizenship Clause provides that \u201c[a]ll persons born\nor naturalized in the United States and subject to the juris-\ndiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the\nState wherein they reside.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a71.\nThat means what it says. Nestled in the Fourteenth\nAmendment alongside the Equal Protection Clause, the\nCitizenship Clause does not discriminate on the basis of\nrace, sex, ethnicity, religion, or, importantly here, parent-\nage. It refers instead to \u201c[a]ll persons born or naturalized\nin the United States.\u201d Ibid.\n  Besides birth, there is only one condition: that one be\n\f4                    TRUMP v.

To be \u201csubject\nto the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States means simply to be\nbound to its authority and its laws. See N. Webster, An\nAmerican Dictionary of the English Language 732 (C.\nGoodrich &amp; N. Porter eds. 1865) (defining jurisdiction as the\n\u201c[p]ower of governing or legislating,\u201d or \u201cthe power or right\nof exercising authority\u201d). As the Government would pre-\nsumably concede, virtually everyone born in the United\nStates and present in its territory is subject to its authority\nand its laws.

For\nthe organizational plaintiffs, the Maryland District Court\nexplained that those plaintiffs have \u201c \u2018over 680,000 mem-\nbers . . . who reside in all 50 U.S. states\u2019 \u201d and \u201chundreds of\nthem expect to give birth soon.\u201d 763 F.

Supp. 3d, at 1153.\nFor one thing, that court explained, the constant flow of\npeople moving in and out of various States meant some chil-\ndren born to noncitizen parents in a nonplaintiff State\nwould later reside in a plaintiff State. Once there, those\nchildren (under state law) would be eligible for state bene-\nfits. Yet due to the Citizenship Order, the plaintiff States\nwould no longer receive federal funding to support those\nbenefits. In addition, the plaintiff States would have to cre-\nate an entirely new administrative and recordkeeping sys-\ntem to accommodate children who were not citizens under\nthe Order and born in a nonplaintiff State. So if the District\nCourt allowed birthright citizenship to continue for chil-\ndren born in the plaintiff States, but not in any other State,\nthat would not completely redress the States\u2019 financial in-\njury.

See 766 F.

Nowhere did the Govern-\nment contest the District Courts\u2019 uniform holdings that the\nCitizenship Order likely violated the Constitution.

Yet the majority throws the doors of\nequity open to the Government in a case where it seeks to\nundo a fundamental and clearly established constitutional\nright. The Citizenship Order\u2019s patent unlawfulness is rea-\nson enough to deny the Government\u2019s applications.\n   The Government also falls well short of satisfying its bur-\nden to show that it will likely suffer irreparable harm ab-\nsent a stay and that it will likely succeed on the merits of\nits challenge to the scope of the injunctions. Nken, 556\nU. S., at 434\u2013435. The Executive Branch has respected\nbirthright citizenship for well over a century, and it ad-\nvances no plausible reason why maintaining the status quo\nwhile the litigation proceeds would cause it irrevocable\nharm. Nor could it, for the Constitution and federal law\nprohibit the enforcement of the Citizenship Order.\n   For all that, moreover, the Government is not even cor-\nrect on the merits of universal injunctions. To the contrary,\nuniversal injunctions are consistent with long-established\nprinciples of equity, once respected by this Court. What is\nmore, these cases do not even squarely present the legality\nof universal injunctions.

This Court\u2019s precedent establishes beyond a shade\nof doubt that the Executive Order is unconstitutional. See\nsupra, at 3\u20139. Thus, by enjoining the Government from vi-\nolating settled law, the District Courts\u2019 orders do not cause\nthe Government any harm.\n   The majority\u2019s contrary position is self-refuting.

Unrebutted record evidence bears this out and shows\nthat the Citizenship Order would irreparably harm the\nStates, even if it does not apply to children born within their\nboundaries.

So even if this Court later rules that the Cit-\nizenship Order is unlawful, we may nevertheless lack the\npower to enjoin enforcement as to anyone not formally a\nparty before the Court. In a case where the Government is\nacting in open defiance of the Constitution, federal law, and\nthis Court\u2019s holdings, it is naive to believe the Government\nwill treat this Court\u2019s opinions on those policies as \u201cde facto\u201d\nuniversal injunctions absent an express order directing to-\ntal nonenforcement.

Because respond-\nents prevailed on the merits and received universal injunc-\ntions, they have no reason to file an appeal. The Govern-\nment has no incentive to file a petition here either, because\nthe outcome of such an appeal would be preordained. The\nGovernment recognizes as much, which is why its emer-\ngency applications challenged only the scope of the prelim-\ninary injunctions.\n   Even accepting that this Court will get the opportunity to\n\u201cac[t] as the ultimate decider\u201d of patently unlawful policies,\nante, at 3 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.), and that the Execu-\ntive Branch will treat this Court\u2019s opinions as de facto uni-\nversal injunctions,11 it is still necessary for the lower courts\nto have the equitable authority to issue universal injunc-\ntions, too.

When the Government says \u201cdo not allow the\nlower courts to enjoin executive action universally as a rem-\nedy for unconstitutional conduct,\u201d what it is actually saying\n\f2                   TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                     JACKSON, J., dissenting\n\nis that the Executive wants to continue doing something\nthat a court has determined violates the Constitution\u2014\nplease allow this. That is some solicitation. With its ruling\ntoday, the majority largely grants the Government\u2019s wish.\nBut, in my view, if this country is going to persist as a Na-\ntion of laws and not men, the Judiciary has no choice but to\ndeny it.\n   Stated simply, what it means to have a system of govern-\nment that is bounded by law is that everyone is constrained\nby the law, no exceptions. And for that to actually happen,\ncourts must have the power to order everyone (including the\nExecutive) to follow the law\u2014full stop. To conclude other-\nwise is to endorse the creation of a zone of lawlessness\nwithin which the Executive has the prerogative to take or\nleave the law as it wishes, and where individuals who would\notherwise be entitled to the law\u2019s protection become subject\nto the Executive\u2019s whims instead.\n   The majority cannot deny that our Constitution was de-\nsigned to split the powers of a monarch between the govern-\ning branches to protect the People. Nor is it debatable that\nthe role of the Judiciary in our constitutional scheme is to\nensure fidelity to law. But these core values are strangely\nabsent from today\u2019s decision. Focusing on inapt compari-\nsons to impotent English tribunals, the majority ignores the\nJudiciary\u2019s foundational duty to uphold the Constitution\nand laws of the United States. The majority\u2019s ruling thus\nnot only diverges from first principles, it is also profoundly\ndangerous, since it gives the Executive the go-ahead to\nsometimes wield the kind of unchecked, arbitrary power the\nFounders crafted our Constitution to eradicate. The very\ninstitution our founding charter charges with the duty to\nensure universal adherence to the law now requires judges\nto shrug and turn their backs to intermittent lawlessness.\nWith deep disillusionment, I dissent.\n\f                  Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

Ante, at 6. But\nthat legalese is a smokescreen. It obscures a far more basic\nquestion of enormous legal and practical significance: May\na federal court in the United States of America order the\nExecutive to follow the law?\n                              A\n   To ask this question is to answer it. In a constitutional\nRepublic such as ours, a federal court has the power to or-\nder the Executive to follow the law\u2014and it must. It is axi-\nomatic that the Constitution of the United States and the\nstatutes that the People\u2019s representatives have enacted\ngovern in our system of government. Thus, everyone, from\nthe President on down, is bound by law. By duty and na-\nture, federal courts say what the law is (if there is a genuine\ndispute), and require those who are subject to the law to\nconform their behavior to what the law requires. This is\nthe essence of the rule of law.\n   Do not take my word for it.

Whatever the source of the majority\u2019s\nconfusion, there is no question that its statutory holding restricting the\ntraditional equitable power of federal courts to craft a suitable remedy\nfor established (or likely) constitutional violations has significant rami-\nfications for the separation of powers and for constitutional rights more\nbroadly.

Notably, the Court\nhas not determined that any of the lower courts were wrong\nabout their conclusion that the executive order likely vio-\nlates the Constitution\u2014the Executive has not asked us to\nrule on the lawfulness of Executive Order No. 14160. But\nthe majority allows the Executive to implement this order\n(which lower courts have so far uniformly declared likely\nunconstitutional) nonetheless.\n   Given the critical role of the Judiciary in maintaining the\nrule of law, see Part I, supra, it is odd, to say the least, that\nthe Court would grant the Executive\u2019s wish to be freed from\nthe constraints of law by prohibiting district courts from or-\ndering complete compliance with the Constitution. But the\n\f8                         TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                          JACKSON, J., dissenting\n\nmajority goes there. It holds that, even assuming that Ex-\necutive Order No. 14160 violates the Constitution, federal\ncourts lack the power to prevent the Executive from contin-\nuing to implement that unconstitutional directive.\n   As I understand the concern, in this clash over the respec-\ntive powers of two coordinate branches of Government, the\nmajority sees a power grab\u2014but not by a presumably law-\nless Executive choosing to act in a manner that flouts the\nplain text of the Constitution. Instead, to the majority, the\npower-hungry actors are . . . (wait for it) . . . the district\ncourts. See ante, at 1 (admonishing district courts for dar-\ning to \u201casser[t] the power\u201d to order the Executive to follow\nthe law universally). In the majority\u2019s view, federal courts\nonly have the power to \u201cafford the plaintiff complete relief \u201d\nin the cases brought before them; they can do nothing more.\nAnte, at 16. And the majority thinks a so-called universal\ninjunction\u2014that is, a court order requiring the Executive to\nfollow the law across the board and not just with respect to\nthe plaintiff\u2014\u201cgrant[s] relief to nonparties.\u201d See ante, at 6\u2013\n8. Therefore, the majority reasons, issuing such orders ex-\nceeds district courts\u2019 authority. See ante, at 21.\n   So many questions arise.2 The majority\u2019s analysis is fully\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Although I will not spend much space discussing it here, the major-\n\nity\u2019s primary premise\u2014that universal injunctions \u201cgrant relief to non-\nparties\u201d\u2014is suspect. When a court issues an injunction (universal or\notherwise), it does so via an order that governs the relationship between\nthe plaintiff and the defendant. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 65(d). That order\nprovides the plaintiff with relief: If the plaintiff believes that the defend-\nant has violated the court\u2019s order, she may come back to court, injunction\nin hand, and demand enforcement or compensation through the mecha-\nnism of civil contempt.

But this cramped characterization of\nthe Judiciary\u2019s function is highly questionable when it\ncomes to suits against the Executive. That is, even if the\nmajority is correct that courts in England at the time of the\nfounding were so limited\u2014and I have my doubts, see ante,\nat 18\u201320 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting)\u2014why would courts in\nour constitutional system be limited in the same way?\n  The Founders of the United States of America squarely\nrejected a governing system in which the King ruled all, and\nall others, including the courts, were his subordinates. In\nour Constitution-centered system, the People are the rulers\nand we have the rule of law. So, it makes little sense to look\nto the relationship between English courts and the King for\nguidance on the power of our Nation\u2019s Judiciary vis-\u00e0-vis its\nExecutive. See The Federalist No. 69, at 416 (A. Hamilton)\n(explaining how the President differs from the King, includ-\ning because \u201c[t]he person of the King of Great Britain is sa-\ncred and inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to\nwhich he is amenable\u201d). Indeed, it is precisely because the\nlaw constrains the Government in our system that the Ju-\ndiciary\u2019s assignment is so broad, per the Constitution. Fed-\neral courts entertain suits against the Government claim-\ning constitutional violations. Thus, the function of the\ncourts\u2014both in theory and in practice\u2014necessarily in-\ncludes announcing what the law requires in such suits for\nthe benefit of all who are protected by the Constitution, not\nmerely doling out relief to injured private parties.\n  Put differently, the majority views the Judiciary\u2019s power\nthrough an aperture that is much too small, leading it to\nthink that the only function of our courts is to provide \u201ccom-\nplete relief \u201d to private parties. Sure, federal courts do that,\nand they do it well. But they also diligently maintain the\nrule of law itself. When it comes to upholding the law, fed-\neral courts ensure that all comers\u2014i.e., everyone to whom\n\f                      Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

Indeed, one might wonder: Why all the\nfuss? After all, the majority recognizes that district courts\ncan still issue universal injunctions in some circumstances.\nSee ante, at 16\u201318. It even acknowledges that the lower\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 No one is saying that the reasoning of a district court\u2019s opinion, on its\n\nown, \u201chas the legal force of a judgment,\u201d ante, at 22; of course it does not.\nThe real issue today\u2019s applications raise is whether district-court opin-\nions are entitled to respect while litigation over the lawfulness of the de-\nfendant\u2019s conduct is ongoing. As I have explained, the majority\u2019s key\nmove is to start by assuming that the remedial power of federal courts is\nquite narrow (i.e., it is only appropriately exercised to grant \u201ccomplete\nrelief \u201d to the parties). Ante, at 5\u201311, 16. The majority forgets (or ignores)\nthat federal courts also make pronouncements of law and issue orders\ncompelling compliance if violations are identified. Then, having zeroed\nin on solely the courts\u2019 plaintiff-specific-remedies function, the majority\nunsurprisingly insists that a district court cannot respond to the Execu-\ntive\u2019s decision to violate the law universally by issuing an order compel-\nling universal cessation of the Executive\u2019s unlawful behavior. This kind\nof broad injunction is merely one tool in a judge\u2019s kit of remedial op-\ntions\u2014one that is directly responsive to the court\u2019s duty to uphold the\nlaw and the Executive\u2019s decision to consciously violate it\u2014and it is no\nmore or less binding than any of the district court\u2019s other determinations.\nSo, rather than disdainfully securing permission to disregard the district\ncourt\u2019s opinion and continue engaging in unlawful conduct vis-\u00e0-vis any-\none who is not the plaintiff, an enjoined Executive that believes the dis-\ntrict court was wrong to conclude that its behavior is unlawful has a rule-\nof-law-affirming response at the ready: It can seek expedited review of\nthe merits on appeal. District courts themselves also have the flexibility\nto stay their injunctions pending appeal, if that is requested and the cir-\ncumstances demand it. But rather than permit lower courts to adapt\ntheir remedies to the particulars of a given case, the majority today ties\njudges\u2019 hands, requiring them to acquiesce to executive lawlessness in\nevery situation.\n\f12                   TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                     JACKSON, J., dissenting\n\ncourts may reimpose the same universal injunctions at is-\nsue in these cases, if the courts find on remand that doing\nso is necessary to provide complete relief to the named\nplaintiffs. See ante, at 19. From the standpoint of out-\ncomes, that\u2019s all welcome news. But, as I explain below,\nfrom the perspective of constitutional theory and actual\npractice, disaster looms.\n  What I mean by this is that our rights-based legal system\ncan only function properly if the Executive, and everyone\nelse, is always bound by law. Today\u2019s decision is a seismic\nshock to that foundational norm. Allowing the Executive to\nviolate the law at its prerogative with respect to anyone\nwho has not yet sued carves out a huge exception\u2014a gash\nin the basic tenets of our founding charter that could turn\nout to be a mortal wound. What is more, to me, requiring\ncourts themselves to provide the dagger (by giving their im-\nprimatur to the Executive Branch\u2019s intermittent lawless-\nness) makes a mockery of the Judiciary\u2019s solemn duty to\nsafeguard the rule of law.\n                               A\n  Do remember: The Executive has not asked this Court to\ndetermine whether Executive Order No. 14160 complies\nwith the Constitution. Rather, it has come to us seeking\nthe right to continue enforcing that order regardless\u2014i.e.,\neven though six courts have now said the order is likely un-\nconstitutional. What the Executive wants, in effect, is for\nthis Court to bless and facilitate its desire to operate in two\ndifferent zones moving forward: one in which it is required\nto follow the law (because a particular plaintiff has secured\na personal injunction prohibiting its unlawful conduct), and\nanother in which it can choose to violate the law with re-\nspect to certain people (those who have yet to sue).\n  In the first zone, law reigns. For the named plaintiffs in\nthe suits before us, for example, the lower courts\u2019 determi-\n\f                      Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

Per the courts\u2019\norders, the Executive is prohibited from denying citizenship\nto the offspring of the named plaintiffs. See ante, at 26\n(leaving the injunctions in place to the extent \u201cnecessary to\nprovide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to\nsue\u201d). Within this zone, the courts\u2019 rule of decision\u2014that\nExecutive Order No. 14160 is likely unconstitutional\u2014ap-\nplies.\n   But with its ruling today, the majority endorses the crea-\ntion of a second zone\u2014one in which that rule of decision has\nno effect. In this zone, which is populated by those who lack\nthe wherewithal or ability to go to court, all bets are off.\nThere is no court-issued mandate requiring the Executive\nto honor birthright citizenship in compliance with the Con-\nstitution, so the people within this zone are left to the pre-\nrogatives of the Executive as to whether their constitutional\nrights will be respected. It does not matter what six federal\ncourts have said about Executive Order No. 14160; those\ncourts are powerless to make the Executive stop enforcing\nthat order altogether. In effect, then, that powerlessness\ncreates a void that renders the Constitution\u2019s constraints\nirrelevant to the Executive\u2019s actions. Of course, the Execu-\ntive might choose to follow the law in this zone as well\u2014but\nthat is left to its discretion. And the Solicitor General has\nnow confirmed that, in the absence of a personal injunction\nsecured by a particular plaintiff, this Executive\u2019s view is\nthat compliance with lower court rulings on matters of con-\nstitutional significance is optional.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The Solicitor General said that quiet part out loud by baldly asserting\n\nthat the Executive reserves the right to defy Circuit precedent. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 33\u201334, 60\u201361. Although he further suggested that the admin-\nistration would abide by precedent from this Court in future similar\ncases, id., at 35, 63, even that seems to be a matter of prerogative, as\nthere is no inherent limit to the limited-scope-of-authority logic that un-\nderlies today\u2019s holding, see ante, at 41 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).

CASA, INC.\n\n                          JACKSON, J., dissenting\n\n   I am not the first to observe that a legal system that op-\nerates on two different tracks (one of which grants to the\nExecutive the prerogative to disregard the law) is anath-\nema to the rule of law.5 Thus, the law-free zone that results\nfrom this Court\u2019s near elimination of universal injunctions\nis not an unfamiliar archetype. Also eerily echoing history\u2019s\nhorrors is the fact that today\u2019s prerogative zone is unlikely\nto impact the public in a randomly distributed manner.\nThose in the good graces of the Executive have nothing to\nfear; the new prerogative that the Executive has to act un-\nlawfully will not be exercised with respect to them. Those\nwho accede to the Executive\u2019s demands, too, will be in the\nclear. The wealthy and the well connected will have little\ndifficulty securing legal representation, going to court, and\nobtaining injunctive relief in their own name if the Execu-\ntive violates their rights.\n   Consequently, the zone of lawlessness the majority has\nnow authorized will disproportionately impact the poor, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nExecutive\u2019s less-than-sterling record of compliance with Supreme Court\nrulings to date casts further doubt on this compliance claim; as JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR has explained, the Executive Order at issue here seems to\nsquarely violate at least one\u2014and perhaps five\u2014of our bedrock prece-\ndents.

No one denies that the power of federal courts is lim-\nited\u2014both by the Constitution and by Congress. But the\nmajority seems to forget (or ignores) that the Constitution\nand Congress also limit the power of the Executive. In ad-\ndition, it is indisputable that the Executive\u2019s power to lev-\nerage physical force in a manner that directly threatens to\ndeprive people of life, liberty, or property creates uniquely\nharmful risks when unconstrained by law. But the majority\ntoday roots its holding in a purported statutory limitation,\nnot a constitutional one. Ante, at 5, n. 4. And, as I have\nexplained, our Constitution gives federal courts the author-\nity to order the Executive to stop acting unlawfully. See\nPart I, supra. To the extent Congress has attempted to\nstrip federal courts of that power via the Judiciary Act (and,\nto be clear, I do not think it has, for the reasons JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR discusses, see ante, at 23\u201331), it is powerless\nto do so.\n   The bottom line is this: If courts do not have the authority\nto require the Executive to adhere to law universally, a\ndual-track system develops in which courts are ousted as\nguardians in some situations and compliance with law\nsometimes becomes a matter of executive prerogative.

Yes,\ncertain named plaintiffs have brought particular lawsuits\nseeking protection of their legal rights. But their claim is\nthat Executive Order No. 14160 violates the Constitution.\nIf the court agrees with them, why on Earth must it permit\nthat unconstitutional government action to take effect at\nall?\n   I have already explained why the majority\u2019s answer\u2014be-\ncause the court is powerless to do anything but give \u201ccom-\nplete relief \u201d to those parties\u2014is wrong in terms of the ac-\ntual scope of federal courts\u2019 authority. See Part I, supra. I\nnow observe that this response also erroneously suggests\nthat a court does something wrongful when it imposes a\nuniversal injunction in a single plaintiff \u2019s lawsuit\u2014akin to\ngiving a windfall to those who do not deserve the law\u2019s pro-\ntection because they have not sued. Ante, at 8\u20139, 12\u201315.\nThis way of conceptualizing universal injunctions mistakes\nthat remedy for the unearned spoils of particular adversar-\nial engagements, rather than a necessary tool employed to\ndefend the Constitution by reinforcing pre-existing rights.\n   Here is what I mean. Our Constitution indisputably con-\n\f                     Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

See n. 2, supra. Rather, the very\nconcept of constitutional rights makes the People intended beneficiaries\nof the constraints that the Constitution imposes on executive action.\n   8 Again, the law binds the Executive from the outset in our constitu-\n\ntional scheme, for the benefit of all. See Part I, supra. Thus, a lawsuit\nis merely the vehicle that invokes the Judiciary\u2019s power to check the Ex-\necutive by enforcing the law. The topsy-turvy scheme the majority cre-\nates today gets those well-established norms exactly backward: The law\ndisappears as an initial constraint on the Executive, and apparently only\n\f18                       TRUMP v.

Imagine an Executive who is-\nsues a blanket order that is blatantly unconstitutional\u2014de-\nmanding, say, that any and all of its political foes be sum-\nmarily and indefinitely incarcerated in a prison outside the\njurisdiction of the United States, without any hearing or\nchance to be heard in court. Shortly after learning of this\nedict, one such political rival rushes into court with his law-\nyer, claims the Executive\u2019s order violates the Constitution,\nand secures an injunction that prohibits the Executive from\nenforcing that unconstitutional mandate. The upshot of to-\nday\u2019s decision is that, despite that rival\u2019s success in per-\nsuading a judge of the unconstitutional nature of the Exec-\nutive\u2019s proclamation, the court\u2019s ruling and injunction can\nonly require the Executive to shelve any no-process incar-\nceration plan that targets that particular individual (the\nnamed plaintiff ); the Executive can keep right on rounding\nup its other foes, despite the court\u2019s clear and unequivocal\npronouncement that the executive order is unlawful.\n   The majority today says that, unless and until the other\npolitical rivals seek and secure their own personal injunc-\ntions, the Executive can carry on acting unconstitutionally\nwith respect to each of them, as if the Constitution\u2019s due\nprocess requirement does not exist. For those who get to\ncourt in time, their right not to be indefinitely imprisoned\nwithout due process will be protected. But if they are una-\nble to sue or get to the courthouse too late, the majority\nsays, oh well, there is nothing to be done, despite the fact\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nexists if a particular plaintiff files a particular lawsuit in a particular\ncourt, claiming his (particular) entitlement.\n\f                     Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

Ante, at 20\u201321.\nIn my view, those downsides pale in comparison to the consequences of\nforcing federal courts to acquiesce to executive lawlessness. Moreover,\nand in any event, the various practical problems critics have identified\nare largely overblown. For example, while many accuse universal in-\njunctions of preventing percolation, the facts of this very suit demon-\nstrate otherwise: Three different District Courts each considered the\nmerits of Executive Order No. 14160, and appeals are now pending in\n\f20                        TRUMP v. CASA, INC.\n\n                          JACKSON, J., dissenting\n\n   I view the demise of the notion that a federal judge can\norder the Executive to adhere to the Constitution\u2014full\nstop\u2014as a sad day for America. The majority\u2019s unpersua-\nsive effort to justify this result makes it sadder still. It is\nthe responsibility of each and every jurist to hold the line.\nBut the Court now requires judges to look the other way\nafter finding that the Executive is violating the law, shame-\nfully permitting unlawful conduct to continue unabated.\n   Today\u2019s ruling thus surreptitiously stymies the Judici-\nary\u2019s core duty to protect and defend constitutional rights.\nIt does this indirectly, by preventing lower courts from tell-\ning the Executive that it has to stop engaging in conduct\nthat violates the Constitution. Instead, now, a court\u2019s\npower to prevent constitutional violations comes with an\nasterisk\u2014a court can make the Executive cease its uncon-\nstitutional conduct *but only with respect to the particular\nplaintiffs named in the lawsuit before them, leaving the Ex-\necutive free to violate the constitutional rights of anyone\nand everyone else.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthree Courts of Appeals. See supra, at 7. Other prudential concerns are\nbetter addressed in more targeted ways, such as by changing venue rules\nto prevent forum or judge shopping, or by encouraging lower courts to\nexpedite their review, thereby teeing the merits up for this Court as\nquickly as possible.\n   That is not to say that universal injunctions can or should be issued in\nevery case; a court must always fit its remedy to the particular case be-\nfore it, and those particulars may caution against issuing universal relief\nin certain instances. See ante, at 22\u201323 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). But\nthe Court today for the first time ever adopts a blanket authority-dimin-\nishing rule: It declares that courts do not have the power to exercise their\nequitable discretion to order the Executive to completely cease acting\npursuant to an unlawful directive (unless doing so is necessary to provide\ncomplete relief to a given plaintiff ). And, again, this very suit illustrates\nwhy that bright line rule goes much too far. As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR em-\nphasizes, multiple courts have recognized that Executive Order No.\n14160 is \u201cpatently unconstitutional under settled law,\u201d and those courts\nthus issued the relief necessary to \u201cprotect newborns from the excep-\ntional, irreparable harm associated with losing a foundational constitu-\ntional right and its immediate benefits.\u201d Ibid.\n\f                  Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.
