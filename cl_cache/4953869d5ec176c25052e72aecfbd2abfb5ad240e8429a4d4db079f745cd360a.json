UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 23\u20131002. Argued January 13, 2025\u2014Decided June 26, 2025*\n\n\nBefore the First Step Act was enacted in 2018, federal judges were re-\n  quired to sentence first-time offenders convicted of violating 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)\u2014a law that criminalizes possessing a firearm while\n  committing other crimes\u2014to \u201cstacked\u201d 25-year periods of incarcera-\n  tion. The First Step Act eliminated this harsh mandatory minimum\n  penalty. Section 403(b) of the Act also made its more lenient penalties\n  partially retroactive. Specifically, if a sentence \u201chas not been imposed\u201d\n  upon an eligible \u00a7924(c) offender as of the date of the First Step Act\u2019s\n  enactment, the Act applies. The question presented here concerns an\n  edge case: What penalties apply when a \u00a7924(c) offender had been sen-\n  tenced as of the Act\u2019s enactment, but that sentence was subsequently\n  vacated, such that the offender must face a post-Act resentencing?\n     In 2009, petitioners Tony Hewitt, Corey Duffey, and Jarvis Ross\n  were convicted of multiple counts of bank robbery and conspiracy to\n  commit bank robbery, along with corresponding \u00a7924(c) offenses for\n  use of a firearm during a crime of violence. Each petitioner received a\n  mandatory 5-year sentence for his first \u00a7924(c) count of conviction and,\n  despite being first-time offenders, each received 25-year mandatory\n  sentences on every \u00a7924(c) count beyond his first. Thus, each peti-\n  tioner\u2019s sentence exceeded 325 years. Petitioners successfully chal-\n  lenged some of their convictions on direct appeal, and the Fifth Circuit\n  vacated petitioners\u2019 sentences. In 2012, the District Court resentenced\n  each petitioner to between 285 and 305 years on the counts that re-\n  mained.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   *Together with No. 23\u20131150, Duffey et al. v. United States, also on cer-\ntiorari to the same court.\n\f2                      HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       In 2019, the Court held that the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d definition the\n    Government routinely used to support some \u00a7924(c) convictions was\n    unconstitutionally vague. See United States v. Davis, 588 U. S. 445,\n    470. Because that holding potentially affected some of petitioners\u2019 re-\n    maining convictions, the Fifth Circuit granted petitioners authoriza-\n    tion to file a second or successive postconviction motion. The District\n    Court then vacated the impacted \u00a7924(c) convictions, as well as peti-\n    tioners\u2019 sentences. When the District Court held resentencings for the\n    remaining convictions, petitioners argued that the First Step Act\u2019s 5-\n    year\u2014not 25-year\u2014mandatory minimum penalties applied. Petition-\n    ers argued they were entitled to retroactive application of the Act\u2019s\n    more lenient penalties because a vacated prior sentence is not a sen-\n    tence that \u201chas . . . been imposed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7403(b). The District\n    Court disagreed and resentenced petitioners under the pre-Act sen-\n    tencing scheme, giving them stacked 25-year mandatory minimums\n    for each \u00a7924(c) count of conviction beyond their first. Petitioners thus\n    each received sentences of 130 years or more.\n       On appeal, petitioners and the Government agreed that the First\n    Step Act should have applied at petitioners\u2019 resentencings. The Fifth\n    Circuit denied their joint request for vacatur. In that court\u2019s view,\n    \u00a7403(b) applies only \u201cto defendants for whom \u2018a sentence . . . ha[d] not\n    been imposed\u2019 as of the enactment date.\u201d 92 F. 4th 304, 310. Because\n    each petitioner had been sentenced (twice) prior to the Act\u2019s enact-\n    ment, the panel concluded that petitioners were not eligible for the\n    First Step Act\u2019s more lenient mandatory minimums.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. Pp. 6\u201312.\n92 F. 4th 304, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I, II, and III, concluding that under \u00a7403(b) of the First Step Act,\n  a sentence \u201chas . . . been imposed\u201d for purposes of that provision if, and\n  only if, the sentence is extant\u2014i.e., has not been vacated. Thus, the\n  Act\u2019s more lenient penalties apply to defendants whose previous\n  \u00a7924(c) sentences have been vacated and who need to be resentenced\n  following the Act\u2019s enactment. Pp. 6\u201312.\n     (a) The text of \u00a7403(b) and the nature of vacatur support this con-\n  clusion. Congress employed the present-perfect tense, requiring eval-\n  uation of whether \u201ca sentence . . . has . . . been imposed\u201d upon the de-\n  fendant, rather than the past-perfect tense that would exclude anyone\n  upon whom a sentence \u201chad\u201d been imposed. The present-perfect tense\n  can refer to \u201can act, state, or condition that is now completed\u201d or \u201ca\n  past action that comes up to and touches the present\u201d and thus conveys\n  that the event in question continues to be true or valid. The Chicago\n  Manual of Style \u00a75.132, p. 268. When used in either sense, the pre-\n\f                      Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  sent-perfect tense addresses whether something has continuing rele-\n  vance to the present, not merely whether it occurred as a historical\n  fact. If an event is merely a relic of history because it was voided by a\n  subsequent action, the past-perfect (not the present-perfect) tense is\n  usually the more appropriate verb choice. The fact that adjacent pro-\n  visions of \u00a7403 contain past-tense verbs only strengthens the conclu-\n  sion that \u00a7403(b)\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense is meaningful.\n  Pp. 6\u201310.\n      (b) Background principles regarding the legal effect of vacatur con-\n  firm that a sentence has been imposed for \u00a7403(b) purposes only so\n  long as it remains valid. When interpreting statutes, the Court recog-\n  nizes that Congress legislates against the backdrop of certain unex-\n  pressed presumptions. One such presumption is that vacated court\n  orders are void ab initio and thus lack any prospective legal effect. A\n  criminal defendant whose conviction has been vacated, for example, is\n  to be treated going forward as though he were never convicted. By\n  operation of legal fiction, the law acts as though the previous convic-\n  tion never occurred. Section 403(b) reflects this commonsense under-\n  standing of background vacatur principles. Just as defendants with\n  vacated prior felony convictions are not precluded from possessing\n  weapons under the federal felon-in-possession ban, \u00a7403(b) retroactiv-\n  ity does not exclude from its scope those whose prior sentences were\n  vacated. By authorizing retroactive application of the First Step Act\u2019s\n  more lenient penalties on any eligible offender upon whom \u201ca sentence\n  . . . has not been imposed,\u201d the text of \u00a7403(b) indicates that only past\n  sentences with continued validity preclude application of the Act\u2019s new\n  penalties.

Decided June 26, 2025\n\n  JUSTICE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court, ex-\ncept as to Parts IV and V.*\n  Before the First Step Act was enacted in 2018, federal\njudges were required to sentence certain first-time offend-\ners convicted of violating 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)\u2014a law that\ncriminalizes the possession of a firearm while committing\nother crimes\u2014to \u201cstacked\u201d 25-year periods of incarceration.\nThe First Step Act, 132 Stat. 5194, eliminated this harsh\nmandatory minimum penalty. Congress also made the\nAct\u2019s more lenient penalties partially retroactive. Section\n403(b) specifies that the Act applies if a sentence \u201chas not\nbeen imposed\u201d upon an eligible \u00a7924(c) offender as of the\ndate of the First Step Act\u2019s enactment. Id., at 5222.\n  The question presented here concerns an edge case: What\npenalties apply when a \u00a7924(c) offender had been sentenced\nas of the Act\u2019s enactment, but that sentence was subse-\nquently vacated, such that the offender must face a post-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   *THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE GORSUCH join all but Parts IV and V\nof this opinion.\n\f2                   HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nAct resentencing? We hold that, under that circumstance,\na sentence \u201chas not been imposed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7403(b).\nThus, the First Step Act\u2019s more lenient penalties apply.\n                               I\n   Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c) criminalizes the use or posses-\nsion of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of vio-\nlence or drug-trafficking offense. The statute prescribes a\n5-year mandatory minimum penalty for any first-time of-\nfense, which must run consecutively to any other term of\nimprisonment. \u00a7\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i), (c)(1)(D)(ii). Before the\nFirst Step Act, \u00a7924(c) also contained a recidivism enhance-\nment that required imposition of an additional 25 years of\nimprisonment (on top of the 5-year mandatory minimum)\nfor any \u201csecond or subsequent conviction under this subsec-\ntion.\u201d \u00a7924(c)(1)(C)(i) (2006 ed.).\n   In Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129 (1993), this Court\ninterpreted that recidivism-related language to require an\nenhanced penalty for each and every \u00a7924(c) count of con-\nviction beyond a defendant\u2019s first\u2014even if those convictions\nwere part of the same criminal prosecution. Id., at 132\u2013\n137. As a result, a first-time offender convicted of two\n\u00a7924(c) counts would receive a mandatory 25-year sentence\non the second count, \u201cstacked\u201d upon (i.e., running consecu-\ntively to) the first count\u2019s mandatory 5-year sentence, for a\ntotal of 30 years of imprisonment.1 And each additional\n\u00a7924(c) count would add another 25 years to that defend-\nant\u2019s total term of incarceration. See id., at 131\u2013132. Un-\nder this \u201cstacking\u201d interpretation of \u00a7924(c)\u2019s recidivism en-\nhancement, sentences for \u00a7924(c) offenses ballooned rapidly\nto span decades or even centuries.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 When this Court decided Deal in 1993, the enhanced mandatory min-\n\nimum penalty under \u00a7924(c) was 20 years. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c) (1988\ned.). Congress increased the mandatory minimum to 25 years in 1998.\nSee \u00a7924(c) (1994 ed., Supp. IV); 112 Stat. 3469.\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  On December 21, 2018, a supermajority of Congress en-\nacted the First Step Act, a landmark piece of legislation\nthat changed the federal criminal-sentencing system in nu-\nmerous respects. See 132 Stat. 5194. Among other things,\n\u00a7403(a) of the First Step Act \u201cclarif[ied]\u201d that district court\njudges are not required to impose stacked 25-year sentences\nwhen sentencing first-time \u00a7924(c) offenders. Id., at 5221\u2013\n5222 (capitalization deleted). Abrogating this Court\u2019s deci-\nsion in Deal, the statute established instead that, for first-\ntime offenders, 5-year mandatory minimums apply to each\ncount of conviction.\n  The First Step Act also addressed the potential for retro-\nactive application of this penalty reduction, by specifically\nidentifying the \u00a7924(c) offenders to whom the Act applied.\nOrdinarily, because judges impose sentences based on the\nstatutory penalties that exist at the time defendants com-\nmit their offenses, 1 U. S. C. \u00a7109, statutory changes to fed-\neral penalties only benefit future offenders. But Congress\naltered this default no-retroactivity rule in the Act itself.\nSection 403(b)\u2014titled \u201cAPPLICABILITY TO PENDING\nCASES\u201d\u2014made \u00a7403(a)\u2019s reduced penalties applicable to\ncertain existing \u00a7924(c) offenders, as follows:\n    \u201cThis section, and the amendments made by this sec-\n    tion, shall apply to any offense that was committed be-\n    fore the date of enactment of this Act, if a sentence for\n    the offense has not been imposed as of such date of en-\n    actment.\u201d \u00a7403(b), 132 Stat. 5222.\n                              II\n  In 2009, petitioners Tony Hewitt, Corey Duffey, and Jar-\nvis Ross were convicted of multiple counts of bank robbery\nand conspiracy to commit bank robbery, along with corre-\nsponding \u00a7924(c) offenses for use of a firearm during a crime\nof violence. Each petitioner received a mandatory 5-year\nsentence as to their first \u00a7924(c) count of conviction. And,\ndespite being first-time offenders, each received 25-year\n\f4                    HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmandatory sentences on every \u00a7924(c) count beyond their\nfirst. Thus, in total, each petitioner\u2019s sentence exceeded 325\nyears. Roughly 25 of those years were due to the robbery\noffenses themselves, while the rest were attributable to\nstacked \u00a7924(c) counts.\n   Petitioners successfully challenged some of their convic-\ntions on direct appeal, and the Fifth Circuit accordingly va-\ncated petitioners\u2019 sentences.2 In 2012, the District Court\nresentenced each petitioner to between 285 and 305 years\non the counts that remained\u2014sentences that the Fifth Cir-\ncuit affirmed on direct review. Petitioners also filed post-\nconviction motions under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255, which were\neach denied.\n   After Congress passed the First Step Act in 2018, this\nCourt held that the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d definition the Gov-\nernment routinely used to support some \u00a7924(c) convictions\nwas unconstitutionally vague. See United States v. Davis,\n588 U. S. 445, 470 (2019). Because that holding potentially\naffected some of petitioners\u2019 remaining convictions, the\nFifth Circuit granted petitioners authorization to file a sec-\nond or successive postconviction motion under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72255. The District Court then vacated the impacted\n\u00a7924(c) convictions, as well as petitioners\u2019 sentences.\n   When the District Court held resentencings for the re-\nmaining convictions, petitioners argued that the First Step\nAct\u2019s 5-year\u2014not 25-year\u2014mandatory minimum penalties\napplied. Petitioners argued that they were entitled to ret-\nroactive application of the First Step Act\u2019s more lenient\npenalties because a vacated prior sentence is not a sentence\nthat \u201chas . . . been imposed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7403(b).3 The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Petitioners were initially convicted of attempted bank robbery, too.\n\nThose convictions\u2014along with the corresponding \u00a7924(c) counts\u2014were\nvacated following petitioners\u2019 successful challenges on direct appeal. See\nUnited States v. Duffey, 456 Fed. Appx. 434, 444\u2013445 (CA5 2012).\n  3 During Duffey\u2019s and Ross\u2019s resentencings before the District Court,\n\nthe Government maintained that petitioners were ineligible for First\n\f                     Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court disagreed and resentenced petitioners under\nthe pre-Act sentencing scheme, giving them stacked 25-\nyear mandatory minimum sentences for each \u00a7924(c) count\nof conviction beyond their first. Petitioners thus each re-\nceived sentences of 130 years or more\u2014105 years of which\nwere attributable to stacked \u00a7924(c) penalties.\n   On appeal, petitioners and the Government agreed that\nthe First Step Act should have applied at petitioners\u2019 resen-\ntencings. The parties thus jointly requested vacatur of pe-\ntitioners\u2019 sentences, which the Fifth Circuit denied. 92\nF. 4th 304, 310 (2024) (case below). In that court\u2019s view,\n\u00a7403(b) applies only \u201cto defendants for whom \u2018a sentence . . .\nha[d] not been imposed\u2019 as of the enactment date.\u201d Ibid.\n(alteration in original). Because each petitioner had been\nsentenced (twice) prior to the Act\u2019s enactment, the panel\nconcluded that petitioners were not eligible for the First\nStep Act\u2019s more lenient mandatory minimums.\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether \u00a7403(b) of the\nFirst Step Act confers the benefit of the Act\u2019s more lenient\npenalties to defendants facing post-Act resentencing follow-\ning vacatur of their pre-Act sentence. 603 U. S. ___ (2024).4\nBecause the United States agrees with petitioners on the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStep Act relief. But, by the time of Hewitt\u2019s resentencing, the Govern-\nment had changed its position; it supported Hewitt\u2019s request for resen-\ntencing under the Act.\n   4 The Courts of Appeals have divided over whether offenders who were\n\nsentenced pre-Act, but whose sentences were later vacated, are eligible\nto receive First Step Act benefits at their post-Act resentencing. Com-\npare United States v. Merrell, 37 F. 4th 571, 577\u2013578 (CA9 2022) (hold-\ning that, under \u00a7403(b), such an offender benefits from the Act at resen-\ntencing), and United States v. Mitchell, 38 F. 4th 382, 386\u2013389 (CA3\n2022) (same), with United States v. Jackson, 995 F. 3d 522, 525\u2013526\n(CA6 2021) (holding that such an offender does not benefit from the Act\nat resentencing, if the prior sentence was vacated after the Act\u2019s enact-\nment); see also United States v. Uriarte, 975 F. 3d 596, 601\u2013602, and n. 3\n(CA7 2020) (en banc) (holding that such an offender benefits from the Act\nif his sentence was vacated prior to the Act\u2019s enactment date, but reserv-\ning judgment as to postenactment vacatur).\n\f6                 HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmerits of their appeals, the Court appointed Michael H.\nMcGinley as amicus curiae to defend the judgment below.\n603 U. S. ___ (2024). He has ably discharged his responsi-\nbilities.\n                              III\n  The Fifth Circuit held, and amicus and the dissent con-\ntend, that \u00a7403(b) excludes any defendant who was sen-\ntenced prior to the enactment date of the First Step Act\u2014\neven if his sentence was later vacated. That is so, in their\nview, because the Act applies only \u201cif a sentence for the of-\nfense has not been imposed as of \u201d the Act\u2019s enactment date,\nand a sentence \u201chas . . . been imposed\u201d upon that defendant\nas a matter of historical fact. 132 Stat. 5222 (emphasis\nadded). But based on the text of \u00a7403(b) and the nature of\nvacatur, we conclude that a sentence has been imposed for\npurposes of that provision if, and only if, the sentence is ex-\ntant\u2014i.e., has not been vacated.\n                              A\n   To understand why this is so, focus first on the language\nCongress used. Most notably, the operative phrase is not\nwritten in the past-perfect tense, excluding anyone upon\nwhom a sentence \u201chad\u201d been imposed. Rather, Congress\nemployed the present-perfect tense\u2014thereby requiring\nevaluation of whether \u201ca sentence . . . has . . . been imposed\u201d\nupon the defendant. \u00a7403(b), 132 Stat. 5222 (emphasis\nadded). In this context, that distinction makes a difference.\nSee United States v. Wilson, 503 U. S. 329, 333 (1992)\n(\u201cCongress\u2019 use of a verb tense is significant in construing\nstatutes\u201d).\n   The present-perfect tense can refer to either (1) \u201can act,\nstate, or condition that is now completed\u201d or (2) \u201ca past ac-\ntion that comes up to and touches the present.\u201d The Chicago\nManual of Style \u00a75.132, p. 268 (17th ed. 2017) (emphasis\n\f                      Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)                       7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nadded). But when used in either sense, the tense simulta-\nneously \u201cinvolves reference to both past and present.\u201d R.\nHuddleston & G. Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar of the\nEnglish Language 143 (2002). That is, while \u201cthe primary\nfocus is on the present,\u201d the past maintains \u201c \u2018current rele-\nvance.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (confirming that the present-perfect tense ad-\ndresses \u201ca time-span beginning in the past and extending\nup to now\u201d).5 Thus, one might employ the present-perfect\ntense to describe situations \u201cinvolv[ing] a specific change of\nstate\u201d that produces a \u201ccontinuing result.\u201d Id., at 145 (bold-\nface deleted).\n  Here is an example. Suppose the U. S. Olympic Commit-\ntee enacted a rule stating that athletes may call themselves\nOlympic champions if a gold medal \u201chas been awarded\u201d to\nthem. Pursuant to that rule, a U. S. sprinter who took first\nplace in the 2016 Summer Olympics\u2019 100-meter finals could\nvalidly proclaim\u2014today\u2014that she is \u201can Olympic cham-\npion.\u201d The existence of her win as a historical event triggers\nthe rule\u2019s proper application, because it gives rise to the in-\nference that the athlete remains an Olympic gold medalist\nat present, thereby justifying her continued use of the\n\u201cOlympic champion\u201d title. See ibid. (explaining that the rel-\nevant \u201cconnection with the present\u201d here would be \u201cthat the\nresultant state still obtains now\u201d).\n  But now imagine that the Olympic Committee stripped\nthis sprinter of her medal after discovering that she used\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 A primary flaw of the dissent\u2019s textual argument is its failure to ap-\n\npreciate that, under either meaning of the present perfect, the event in\nquestion must relate to now. In other words, while the dissent accurately\nobserves that the present-perfect tense can be used in one of two ways,\nsee post, at 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.), it ignores that neither refers to cir-\ncumstances that are wholly in the past. What makes this the present-\nperfect tense is that, in each of its manifestations, there exists a connec-\ntion to the present. See Huddleston, Cambridge Grammar of the English\nLanguage, at 143 (confirming that references \u201cto times wholly before\nnow\u201d\u2014when the present \u201cis explicitly or implicitly excluded\u201d\u2014are\nlargely \u201cincompatible with the present perfect\u201d).\n\f8                    HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nperformance-enhancing drugs during the competition. Can\nthat athlete, under the rule, still call herself an Olympic\nchampion? The answer is no. Yes, she had been awarded\nsuch a medal, but it was revoked; the fact that she stood on\nthe podium and was declared the winner in 2016 is inappo-\nsite for purposes of establishing whether she qualifies for\nOlympic-champion bragging rights under the rule today.6\n   When used in this way, the present-perfect tense conveys\nto a listener that the event in question continues to be true\nor valid. The dissent counters that, for purposes of the First\nStep Act, the relevant moment of analysis should not be the\npresent, but rather the statute\u2019s date of enactment. See\npost, at 4\u20135. But that reframing is inconsistent with nor-\nmal understandings of the present-perfect tense, which by\ndefinition focuses on the present.7 Today, if an event is\nmerely a relic of history because it was voided by a subse-\nquent action, the past-perfect (not the present-perfect)\ntense would usually be the more appropriate verb choice.\nSee B. Garner, Modern English Usage 1082 (5th ed. 2022)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The dissent does not dispute that a sprinter who is divested of her\n\ngold medal no longer qualifies as an \u201cOlympic champion\u201d under the hy-\npothetical rule. Nor does the dissent contest that, if the Committee\nwanted such a disqualified sprinter to be able to still claim the title, it\ncould phrase the rule in the past-perfect tense to accomplish that result\n(i.e., bestowing the honorific if a gold medal \u201chad been awarded\u201d to the\nathlete). The dissent\u2019s primary response to this hypothetical is, instead,\nto zero in on \u201c[t]he obvious purpose of the hypothetical rule\u201d and to ex-\nplain that \u201cthe meaning of language is heavily dependent on context.\u201d\nPost, at 10, n. 3. Part IV of this opinion fully addresses the context of\n\u00a7403(b)\u2019s language and Congress\u2019s primary objectives for enacting that\nprovision\u2014both of which support the Court\u2019s conclusion in this case.\n   7 And, notably, there is a relevant connection to the present in the op-\n\neration of \u00a7403(b) despite that statute\u2019s express reference to the date of\nthe Act\u2019s enactment: the current occasion of the sentencing of the defend-\nant in question. Sentencing courts read statutes at the moment of their\napplication\u2014which, here, would be the moment of resentencing, not the\nmoment of enactment. From that proper vantage point, petitioners were\nnot subject to a sentence, as any previous sentence had been vacated.\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(explaining that the past-perfect tense \u201crepresents an ac-\ntion as completed at some definite time in the past\u2014that is,\nbefore some other past time referred to\u201d); Chicago Manual\nof Style \u00a75.133, at 268 (confirming that the past perfect \u201cre-\nfers to an act, state, or condition that was completed before\nanother specified or implicit past time or past action\u201d). Our\ndisqualified sprinter could thus still boast of her Olympic-\nchampion status if the rule were, instead, that any athlete\nwho \u201chad been awarded\u201d a gold medal was entitled to use\nthat honorific.\n    The fact that adjacent provisions of \u00a7403 contain past-\ntense verbs only strengthens the conclusion that \u00a7403(b)\u2019s\nuse of the present-perfect tense is meaningful. Cf. Barrett\nv. United States, 423 U. S. 212, 217 (1976) (emphasizing\nwhen Congress \u201cused the present perfect tense . . . in con-\ntrast to its use of the present tense\u201d elsewhere in the stat-\nute). Section 404(c), for example, utilizes the simple past\ntense to address a defendant\u2019s prior sentencing. See 132\nStat. 5222 (\u201cNo court shall entertain a motion made under\nthis section to reduce a sentence if the sentence was previ-\nously imposed or previously reduced in accordance with\u201d\nthe relevant amendments (emphasis added)). The past\ntense also features earlier in \u00a7403(b) itself. See ibid. (cov-\nering \u201cany offense that was committed before the date of\nenactment of [the] Act\u201d (emphasis added)). But the verb\ntense at issue here (\u201chas been\u201d) is conspicuously different\u2014\nmaking only clearer that a past sentence must have a rele-\nvant connection to the present for purposes of the retroac-\ntivity provision.\n    Indeed, amicus and the dissent\u2019s historical-fact reading\nof \u00a7403(b) calls so naturally for the past-perfect tense that\njurists who share this view often employ that tense by de-\nfault. The Fifth Circuit below, for instance, stated that \u201cthe\nFirst Step Act applies to defendants for whom \u2018a sentence\n. . . ha[d] not been imposed\u2019 as of the enactment date.\u201d 92\nF. 4th, at 310 (alteration in original). Other courts have\n\f10                HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nconstrued \u00a7403(b) similarly. See, e.g., United States v.\nJackson, 995 F. 3d 522, 525 (CA6 2021) (noting that \u201cas of\nDecember 21, 2018, a sentence had been imposed\u201d upon the\ndefendant, even though it was later vacated). Congress of\ncourse \u201ccould have phrased its requirement in language\nthat looked to the past . . . , but it did not choose this readily\navailable option.\u201d Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesa-\npeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 57 (1987). The\nnatural inference, then, is that Congress meant what it\nsaid, and, thus, that \u00a7403(b) covers only past sentences with\ncontinued legal validity, not those that have been vacated.\n                                B\n   Background principles regarding the legal effect of vaca-\ntur confirm that a sentence has been imposed for \u00a7403(b)\npurposes only so long as it remains valid. When interpret-\ning statutes, we \u201crecogniz[e] that \u2018Congress legislates\nagainst the backdrop,\u2019 of certain unexpressed presump-\ntions.\u201d Bond v. United States, 572 U. S. 844, 857 (2014)\n(quoting EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244,\n248 (1991)). One such presumption is that vacated court\norders are void ab initio and thus lack any prospective legal\neffect. See United States v. Ayres, 9 Wall. 608, 610 (1870)\n(\u201c[V]acating the former judgment . . . render[s] it null and\nvoid, and the parties are left in the same situation as if no\ntrial had ever taken place in the cause\u201d). By operation of\nlegal fiction, the law acts as though the vacated order never\noccurred.\n   A criminal defendant whose judgment of conviction has\nbeen vacated, for example, is to be treated going forward as\nthough he were never convicted. See Fiswick v. United\nStates, 329 U. S. 211, 223 (1946) (confirming that one whose\nconviction is vacated \u201cstand[s] in the position of any [per-\nson] who has been accused of a crime but not yet shown to\nhave committed it\u201d).

While the owner\nhad been convicted of fraud, that judgment was invalidated\nand therefore became legally inoperable. In other words,\nthat vacated conviction is subsequently treated as no con-\nviction at all. See North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711,\n721 (1969) (verifying that vacatur causes a conviction to be\n\u201cwholly nullified and the slate wiped clean\u201d).8\n  Section 403(b) reflects this \u201ccommon-sense\u201d understand-\ning of background vacatur principles. Lewis v. United\nStates, 445 U. S. 55, 61, n. 5 (1980). Just as defendants\nwith vacated prior felony convictions are not precluded from\npossessing weapons under the federal felon-in-possession\nban, \u00a7403(b) retroactivity does not exclude from its ambit\nthose whose prior sentences have been vacated. See ibid.;\n18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1); see also Pepper v. United States, 562\nU.

See post, at 12\u201314. But the cases it cites do not\nsupport that contention. In Lewis v. United States, 445 U. S. 55 (1980),\nfor example, we considered whether the invalidity of one\u2019s predicate fel-\nony conviction precludes conviction as a felon in possession of a weapon\nunder federal law. Id., at 58. We concluded the federal conviction could\nstand when the defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction had \u201cnever been over-\nturned\u201d\u2014i.e., vacated\u2014at the time he possessed the weapon. Id., at 57.\nBut we dismissed as \u201cextreme\u201d arguments suggesting that a vacated con-\nviction could have such prospective legal effect. Id., at 61, n. 5 (confirm-\ning the \u201ccommon-sense\u201d notion that \u201ca disability based upon one\u2019s status\nas a convicted felon\u201d ceases as a matter of law as soon as \u201cthe conviction\nupon which that status depends has been vacated\u201d). Bravo-Fernandez v.\nUnited States, 580 U. S. 5 (2016), is similarly unhelpful. That case con-\ncerned issue preclusion and jury findings and does not stand for the prop-\nosition that a vacated order itself retains continuing legal effect in the\nrelevant sense.\n\f12                  HEWITT v.

A\njudge would thus correctly conclude at resentencing that, if\nan offender\u2019s past sentence has been vacated, a sentence\n\u201chas not been imposed\u201d upon that offender for purposes of\nthe First Step Act; hence, the court can impose a new sen-\ntence today.\n                             IV\n                              A\n  The context and enactment history of the First Step Act\nand \u00a7403(b) further demonstrate that Congress\u2019s choice of\nthe present-perfect tense was not accidental.

Rec. S7645 (Dec. 17, 2018) (statement\nof Sen. Durbin); see also Brief for Sen. Richard J. Durbin\net al. as Amici Curiae 5\u20138 (Senators Brief ). The First Step\nAct was the much-anticipated, much-heralded fruit of their\nlabor\u2014and one that many in Congress hoped would yield\nimmediate benefits. See id., at 17.12\n                              B\n   It is noteworthy for present purposes that the statute\nCongress crafted to depart from the much-maligned \u201cstack-\ning\u201d sentencing regime did so in a two-part fashion. First,\n\u00a7403(a) eliminated 25-year stacked sentences for first-time\n\u00a7924(c) offenders. Second, \u00a7403(b) addressed the retroac-\ntivity of the \u00a7403(a) benefit in a \u201c \u2018targeted way,\u2019 \u201d so as to\nensure that judges were no longer constrained to impose 25-\nyear stacked sentences on first-time \u00a7924(c) offenders mov-\ning forward. Id., at 15 (quoting 164 Cong. Rec., at S7645\n(statement of Sen. Durbin)).\n   That second part of Congress\u2019s response\u2014the focus of the\ncases before us today\u2014was highly consequential. By dis-\nplacing the background rule that changes to sentencing\nstatutes apply only prospectively (to defendants who com-\nmit their offenses after the law\u2019s effective date), Congress\nmade clear that the First Step Act\u2019s more lenient penalties\nwere to apply to some \u201c \u2018pending\u2019 \u201d cases, too\u2014i.e., the new\npenalties would be applicable to certain defendants who\nhad committed their offenses before the First Step Act.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 The dissent agrees that our job is to \u201cinterpret what Congress meant\u201d\n\nby the words in \u00a7403(b). Post, at 4. Here, Congress\u2019s desire to change\nthe derided, draconian sentencing stacking scheme Deal had created\ncould not be clearer. Thus, far from \u201cmarch[ing] in the parade of sen-\ntencing reform,\u201d post, at 2, we are merely observing the events and cir-\ncumstances that led Congress to take up the banner of sentencing reform\nitself.\n\f16                HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of JACKSON, J.\n\nSenators Brief 15 (quoting \u00a7403(b), 132 Stat. 5222). Per\n\u00a7403(b), any defendant who still needed to be sentenced as\nof the First Step Act\u2019s effective date would receive the Act\u2019s\nmore lenient penalties. Thus, as a practical matter, judges\nwould no longer have to impose harsh \u201cstacked\u201d sentences\nupon first-time \u00a7924(c) offenders.\n   Notably, because \u00a7403(b) retroactivity was only partial, it\ndiffered substantially from the full retroactivity Congress\nemployed with respect to other kinds of penalty changes it\ninstituted in the First Step Act. See, e.g., \u00a7404(b), 132 Stat.\n5222; Terry v. United States, 593 U. S. 486, 491 (2021) (ex-\nplaining that Congress made the First Step Act\u2019s statutory\nchanges to the crack-cocaine minimums fully retroactive,\nand thus \u201cgave courts authority to reduce the sentences\u201d of\npreviously sentenced crack offenders, where applicable).\nCongress certainly had the full-retroactivity option before\nit when it crafted \u00a7403; indeed, earlier versions of the Act\nwould have extended \u00a7403(a) benefits to at least some\n\u00a7924(c) offenders who were already sentenced. See, e.g.,\nSentencing Reform Act of 2015, H. R. 3713, 114th Cong., 2d\nSess., \u00a75(b)(2), pp. 14\u201316 (2016) (providing for reduced\nterms of imprisonment in \u201ccertain past cases\u201d (capitaliza-\ntion and italics deleted)); Sentencing Reform and Correc-\ntions Act of 2017, S. 1917, 115th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7104(b)(2),\npp. 13\u201315 (2017) (permitting \u201csentence reduction\u201d for cer-\ntain \u201cpast cases\u201d (capitalization deleted)). But authorizing\nthe reopening of closed cases upends finality and can also\nbe administratively burdensome. See Senators Brief 15\n(noting that Congress forwent full retroactivity to serve \u201cju-\ndicial economy\u201d and \u201cpreserv[e] sentences that were actu-\nally valid and final\u201d). Section 403\u2019s partial retroactivity\navoided these problems, while still advancing Congress\u2019s\naim of changing how first-time \u00a7924(c) defendants are sen-\ntenced.\n   In short, \u00a7403(b)\u2014a middle-ground solution to the prob-\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)            17\n\n                     Opinion of JACKSON, J.\n\nlem of harsh \u201cstacked\u201d sentences for first-time \u00a7924(c) of-\nfenders\u2014reflected a balance of Congress\u2019s policy objectives.\nBy leaving intact \u00a7924(c) sentences that judges had already\nimposed, Congress reinforced its interest in finality and\navoided burdening district courts with additional litigation.\nBut it also substantially advanced its goal of returning a\nsignificant amount of sentencing discretion to district court\njudges moving forward, by giving retroactive effect to the\nAct\u2019s more lenient penalties for those first-time \u00a7924(c) of-\nfenders who had yet to be sentenced.\n                                V\n   The reading of \u00a7403(b) that petitioners and the Govern-\nment promote thus coheres with the text, context, and his-\ntory of that provision. Under this view, First Step Act sen-\ntencing benefits apply to all first-time \u00a7924(c) offenders\nsentenced after the Act\u2019s enactment date (whether it is an\ninitial sentencing or a resentencing). This means that\n\u00a7403(b)\u2019s retroactivity line falls between those past \u00a7924(c)\noffenders with final sentences that are still in effect, on the\none hand, and those who still need to be sentenced for their\n\u00a7924(c) offense, on the other. The former are stuck with\ntheir old sentences, for finality reasons, while the latter are\neligible for First Step Act benefits at resentencing, since\nthey have to be sentenced regardless.\n   Under amicus and the dissent\u2019s reading, however, there\nexists a further line of division within the group of offenders\nwho currently lack a sentence\u2014separating those who have\nbeen sentenced previously for the \u00a7924(c) offense at issue\nfrom those who have not. For individuals in the former\ncamp, per amicus and the dissent, a judge must return to\nthe superseded sentencing scheme and impose stacked 25-\nyear sentences when such defendants are resentenced.\n   Carving up the yet-to-be-sentenced group of offenders in\nthis way does not reflect Congress\u2019s intent. See Senators\nBrief 17 (a bipartisan group of Senators, explaining that\n\f18               HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of JACKSON, J.\n\n\u201c[t]he considerations animating the First Step Act\u2019s enact-\nment undermine any suggestion that Congress intention-\nally excluded from Section 403\u2019s reach pre-Act offenders\nwhose sentences are invalid as a matter of law\u201d). Nor does\nit comport with the statutory scheme that Congress en-\nacted, for two primary reasons.\n   First, the text and context of \u00a7403(b) do not support dif-\nferentiating between \u00a7924(c) offenders on the mere basis of\nthe historical fact of a past sentencing (as we explained in\nPart III, supra), and, frankly, it is not clear what distin-\nguishing between previously sentenced and never-before-\nsentenced offenders would accomplish. The prior imposi-\ntion of a sentence does not bear on finality; if the offender\ncurrently lacks a sentence, then a court will have to resen-\ntence the defendant in any event. And though it would\nmake sense to draw the line as amicus and the dissent do if\nthe prior imposition of a sentence helped judges to more ac-\ncurately identify serious first-time \u00a7924(c) offenders\u2014po-\ntentially justifying the harsh and outdated stacked penal-\nties that the First Step Act supplanted\u2014nothing in the\nlegislative record suggests this is so. Stated simply: The\ndistinction between previously sentenced defendants and\nthose who have never been sentenced before seems to make\nno difference in terms of the retroactivity aims of the stat-\nute.\n   By contrast, requiring judges to impose Deal-era stacked\n\u00a7924(c) sentences at resentencings runs headlong into the\nanimating aims of the First Step Act. See Miller v. French,\n530 U. S. 327, 341 (2000) (rejecting an interpretation that\nwould undermine the statute and run \u201cplainly contrary to\nCongress\u2019 intent in enacting\u201d it). Neither amicus nor the\ndissent can explain why Congress would have wanted sen-\ntencing judges, who are presently working to dole out pro-\nportionate plenary sentences under the new regime, to have\nto return to the draconian, pre-Act scheme for offenders\nwho just happen to be facing resentencing, as opposed to\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfirst sentencing. Requiring that kind of reversion prevents\njudges from uniformly moving past Deal, which was the pri-\nmary point of Congress\u2019s enactment of \u00a7403.\n   Second, the reading of \u00a7403(b) that we adopt today is\nplainly more administrable than the one amicus and the\ndissent offer. Amicus argues that his interpretation is easy\nto apply, because a district judge only needs to know\nwhether a prior sentence had ever been imposed upon the\ndefendant for the relevant offense. But that knowledge is\nnot enough\u2014the sentencing judge would still need to refer-\nence, recall, and apply the superseded \u201cstacking\u201d regime, if\napplicable. And there is a much more straightforward way\nto administer \u00a7403(b): From the Act\u2019s enactment date on-\nward, sentencing judges impose the First Step Act\u2019s less-\nened mandatory minimums for any first-time \u00a7924(c) of-\nfender\u2014full stop. This reading of \u00a7403(b) requires no\nadditional effort on the part of the judge to track down a\ndefendant\u2019s sentencing history or to confirm what manda-\ntory minimums previously governed. And it allows district\njudges to treat all first-time \u00a7924(c) defendants who appear\nbefore them for sentencing in an equitable manner that\nminimizes sentencing disparities, consistent with Con-\ngress\u2019s sentencing directives.\n                         *    *    *\n   Under the interpretation of \u00a7403(b) we adopt today, all\nfirst-time \u00a7924(c) offenders who appear for sentencing after\nthe First Step Act\u2019s enactment date\u2014including those whose\nprevious \u00a7924(c) sentences have been vacated and who thus\nneed to be resentenced\u2014are subject to the Act\u2019s revised\npenalties. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary reading of \u00a7403(b) is\nreversed, and its judgment in these cases is remanded for\nfurther proceedings.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U.

HEWITT, PETITIONER\n23\u20131002                 v.\n                  UNITED STATES\n\n   COREY DEYON DUFFEY, ET AL., PETITIONERS\n23\u20131150             v.\n              UNITED STATES\n ON PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n        Nos. 23\u20131002 and 23\u20131150. Decided June 26, 2025\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS, JUSTICE\nKAVANAUGH, and JUSTICE BARRETT join, dissenting.\n   In the First Step Act of 2018, Congress reduced the\nmandatory-minimum sentence for certain firearm offenses.\nLike all changes to sentencing law, this amendment applies\nprospectively. But Congress also thought it wise to apply\nthe amendment to \u201cPending Cases.\u201d Of course, \u201cPending\nCases\u201d does not mean \u201cAll Cases,\u201d and Congress limited the\nretroactive reach of the amendment to defendants for whom\n\u201ca sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of [the\nAct\u2019s] date of enactment.\u201d 132 Stat. 5222. In other words,\nthe amendment applies retroactively only if the defendant\nhad yet to be sentenced when Congress passed the Act in\n2018. Petitioners, who were sentenced in 2010, do not come\nclose to meeting that test.\n   Today, the Court disfigures the Act in order to reach a\ndifferent result. Its interpretation relies on two necessary\npremises. First, the Court insists that what Congress re-\nally meant to say is that the amendment applies retroac-\ntively unless \u201ca legally valid sentence\u201d is in force on the\nAct\u2019s date of enactment. Second, to get around the fact that\npetitioners did have \u201clegally valid\u201d sentences when the Act\n\f2                 HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwas passed, the Court invents a novel \u201cvacatur\u201d principle.\nThe Court tells us that the 2022 vacatur of petitioners\u2019 sen-\ntences rendered those sentences legal nullities from their\ninception. The Court\u2019s interpretation thus unspools the\nAct\u2019s carefully wound retroactivity command to mean that\nany defendant whose sentence is vacated at any time and\nfor any reason may claim the benefit of the Act\u2019s reduced\nmandatory minimum. But nothing in the text or broader\ncontext supports such a boundless interpretation. Indeed,\nthe portions of today\u2019s decision that command the votes of\nonly three Justices give the game away. Animating the\nCourt\u2019s atextual interpretation is a thinly veiled desire to\nmarch in the parade of sentencing reform. But our role is\nto interpret the statute before us, not overhaul criminal\nsentencing.\n                               I\n   Sixteen years ago, a jury convicted petitioners Corey\nDuffey, Tony Hewitt, and Jarvis Ross of multiple 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(c) offenses for use of a firearm in furtherance of a\ncrime of violence. At the time, first-time \u00a7924(c) offenders\nlike petitioners could receive, after a single trial, a 5-year\nmandatory-minimum sentence for an initial \u00a7924(c) convic-\ntion and a consecutive 25-year mandatory-minimum sen-\ntence for each \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d \u00a7924(c) conviction.\nSee \u00a7\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i), (c)(1)(C), (c)(1)(D)(ii) (2012 ed.); Deal\nv. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 137 (1993). In 2010, the\nDistrict Court sentenced petitioners under this so-called\nstacking procedure, and after a remand, the District Court\nresentenced petitioners in 2012. Direct review of their con-\nvictions and sentences was complete by 2015. See United\nStates v. Ross, 544 Fed. Appx. 544, 545 (CA5 2013) (per cu-\nriam) (dismissing Duffey\u2019s appeal because it presented \u201cno\nnonfrivolous issue for appellate review\u201d); United States v.\nRoss, 582 Fed.

S. 1201 (2015) (denying Hewitt\u2019s petition for a writ\nof certiorari).\n   Petitioners\u2019 sentences had thus long been final when Con-\ngress enacted the First Step Act on December 21, 2018. The\nAct introduced a bevy of sentencing reforms, including an\namendment that eliminated the practice of \u00a7924(c) sentence\nstacking. See 132 Stat. 5221\u20135222. Although it had previ-\nously considered applying this amendment to all \u00a7924(c) of-\nfenders (including those with final sentences), see S. 2123,\n114th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7104(b)(2) (2015) (reported by Com-\nmittee), Congress settled on a far narrower retroactivity\ncommand:\n      \u201cAPPLICABILITY TO PENDING CASES.\u2014This section,\n    and the amendments made by this section, shall apply\n    to any offense that was committed before the date of\n    enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has\n    not been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d 132\n    Stat. 5222.\nOn the \u201cdate of enactment,\u201d petitioners\u2019 2012 sentences re-\nmained in full force. As such, petitioners did not move to\nreduce their sentences in the immediate aftermath of the\nAct\u2019s passage.\n  But several strokes of good fortune soon came petitioners\u2019\nway. The year after Congress passed the First Step Act, we\nheld in United States v. Davis, 588 U. S. 445, 448 (2019),\nthat \u00a7924(c)\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague.\nThen, later that same year, the Fifth Circuit determined\nthat Davis should apply retroactively. See United States v.\nReece, 938 F. 3d 630, 635 (2019). Seeking to take advantage\nof these fortuitous developments, petitioners successfully\nmoved to set aside some, though not all, of their \u00a7924(c) con-\nvictions that were predicated on the residual clause. Alt-\nhough the District Court could have vacated petitioners\u2019\nsentences for only those invalid \u00a7924(c) counts, petitioners\ncaught yet another lucky break. The District Court opted\n\f4                 HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nto vacate their entire sentences and ordered plenary resen-\ntencing on the remaining counts. Petitioners now try to\npush their luck even further, contending that the District\nCourt should apply the First Step Act\u2019s reduced mandatory\nminimum for their remaining \u00a7924(c) counts.\n                                II\n  As all agree, petitioners\u2019 argument requires us to inter-\npret what Congress meant when it said \u201ca sentence for the\noffense has not been imposed as of [the Act\u2019s] date of enact-\nment.\u201d What first jumps out about this provision is that\nCongress used the present-perfect tense in the phrase \u201chas\nnot been imposed.\u201d The present-perfect tense \u201cdenotes an\nact, state, or condition that\u201d is either (1) \u201cnow completed\u201d or\n(2) \u201ccontinues up to the present.\u201d The Chicago Manual of\nStyle \u00a75.132, p. 268 (17th ed. 2017).\n  Context often indicates whether a speaker is using the\nformer sense of the present-perfect tense (e.g., \u201che has been\nawarded a trophy\u201d) or the latter sense of the present-perfect\ntense (e.g., \u201che has trained for a trophy for the last three\nyears\u201d). See B. Garner, The Chicago Guide to Grammar,\nUsage, and Punctuation 97 (2016). Consider the following\nexample. Suppose I ask a man passing by a courthouse,\n\u201cHas a sentence been imposed on John Smith?\u201d He could\nrespond either, \u201cYes, on July 1\u201d or \u201cYes, since July 1.\u201d The\nformer response is perhaps the more natural one, and it as-\nsumes I asked for the historical fact of Smith\u2019s sentencing\nin the indefinite past. The latter response is correct (though\nperhaps awkward), and it assumes I asked about the con-\ntinuing legal validity of Smith\u2019s sentence up to the present.\n  The First Step Act\u2019s \u201cgrammatical structure conceivably\nleaves some room for either reading,\u201d United States v. Uri-\narte, 975 F. 3d 596, 607 (CA7 2020) (en banc) (Barrett, J.,\ndissenting), but petitioners lose either way. On one hand,\nthe phrase \u201ca sentence . . . has . . . been imposed as of [the\nAct\u2019s] date of enactment\u201d could refer to the historical fact\n\f                      Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)                        5\n\n                            ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat a district court imposed a sentence before the Act\u2019s pas-\nsage, regardless of whether that sentence remains legally\nvalid in the future. This \u201chistorical-fact interpretation\u201d\nplainly forecloses relief for petitioners because, as no one\ndisputes, the District Court first imposed their sentences\nwell before the Act\u2019s passage.1 On the other hand, \u201ca sen-\ntence . . . has . . . been imposed as of [the Act\u2019s] date of en-\nactment\u201d could mean that a defendant was subject to a le-\ngally valid sentence that continued to be in force on the\nAct\u2019s enactment date. But again, petitioners did have le-\ngally valid sentences \u201cas of [the Act\u2019s] date of enactment,\u201d\nso they lose under this \u201clegal-validity interpretation\u201d of the\nAct too.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Court dismisses the historical-fact interpretation out of hand be-\n\ncause, as it understands English grammar, the present-perfect tense re-\nquires \u201ca connection to the present.\u201d Ante, at 7, n. 5. But before pro-\nnouncing new rules of grammar, the Court might first consider\nconsulting the authorities it cites. See, e.g., R. Huddleston & G. Pullum,\nThe Cambridge Grammar of the English Language 144 (2002) (noting\nthe \u201cpresent perfect allows for the inclusion, under restrictive conditions,\nof a past time adjunct\u201d). As these authorities suggest, the present-perfect\ntense allows one to say, for example, \u201c[h]e has got up at five o\u2019clock,\u201d ibid.\n(emphasis deleted), or \u201che has played golf before yesterday.\u201d\n   2 The Act\u2019s requirement that a sentence \u201chas . . . been imposed as of\n\n[the Act\u2019s] date of enactment\u201d provides an essential temporal benchmark\nfor both the historical-fact and the legal-validity interpretation. Re-\nmarkably, however, the Court reads this requirement out of the Act en-\ntirely. The Court insists that sentencing courts should \u201cread\u201d the First\nStep Act at \u201cthe moment of resentencing,\u201d without any reference to the\nAct\u2019s enactment date. Ante, at 8, n. 7. But the Court is mistaken. It\nstarts on the right foot, acknowledging the \u201cwidely accepted modern leg-\nislative drafting convention that a law should not be read to speak as of\nthe date of enactment.\u201d Carr v. United States, 560 U. S. 438, 463 (2010)\n(ALITO, J., dissenting). This \u201cconvention\u201d provides that, \u201cexcept in unu-\nsual circumstances,\u201d \u201call laws . . . should be written in the present tense\u201d\nto ensure that a \u201c \u2018legislative provision speaks as of any date on which it\nis read (rather than as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect).\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (quoting Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Draft-\ning Manual \u00a7103(a), p. 4 (1997) (emphasis deleted)). But the First Step\nAct is such an \u201cunusual circumstanc[e]\u201d in which Congress deviated from\n\f6                   HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Realizing the Act\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense alone\ncannot help petitioners, the Court invents a novel \u201cvacatur\u201d\nprinciple to supercharge the legal-validity interpretation.\nThe Court tells us that the First Step Act incorporates the\nbackground \u201cpresumption\u201d that \u201cvacated court orders are\nvoid ab initio and thus lack any prospective legal effect.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. This revamped version of the legal-validity in-\nterpretation means that \u201ca sentence . . . has . . . been im-\nposed as of [the Act\u2019s] date of enactment\u201d if a defendant re-\nceives a legally valid sentence before the Act\u2019s passage and\nthat sentence is never, at any future time, vacated. Under\nthis view, the 2022 vacatur of petitioners\u2019 2012 sentences\nimplies that, \u201c[b]y operation of [a] legal fiction,\u201d their 2012\nsentences \u201cnever occurred\u201d and so could not have been le-\ngally valid as of the Act\u2019s enactment date. Ibid.\n   The Court\u2019s vacatur-inflected legal-validity interpreta-\ntion thus rests on two necessary premises. First, the legal-\nvalidity interpretation is superior to the historical-fact in-\nterpretation. Second, the Act incorporates the \u201cvacatur\u201d\nprinciple. If either premise falters, so does the Court\u2019s in-\nterpretation. In my view, there is little doubt that both of\nthe necessary premises fail.\n                              III\n                               A\n  To start, the most plausible reading of the retroactivity\nprovision is that \u201ca sentence . . . has . . . been imposed\u201d\nwhen, as a matter of historical fact, a district court has sen-\ntenced a defendant. Subsequent legal changes\u2014such as the\nvacatur of a previously imposed sentence\u2014do not change\nthe purely historical fact that a defendant was, at a point\nin time, actually sentenced. When the Act asks whether a\nsentence \u201chas . . . been imposed,\u201d it refers to the unchanging\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthis \u201cconvention.\u201d The Act takes the unusual steps of referencing the\ndate on which it was \u201cenacted\u201d and employing the present-perfect tense,\nnot the ordinary present tense.\n\f                   Cite as: 606 U.

United States, 367 U. S. 421, 426 (1961); see Young\nv. United States, 943 F. 3d 460, 463 (CADC 2019) (\u201c[I]n or-\ndinary usage a sentence is \u2018imposed\u2019 when the district court\npronounces it\u201d). The Sentencing Reform Act treats the \u201cim-\nposition\u201d of a sentence as the moment when a district court\n\u201cstate[s] in open court the reasons for . . . the particular sen-\ntence.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(c); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1470\n(12th ed. 2024) (defining \u201cpronounce\u201d as \u201cannounce for-\nmally\u201d). The word \u201cimposed\u201d is thus most naturally under-\nstood to refer to a concrete \u201caction by a district court\u201d that\noccurs at a specific point in time. Uriarte, 975 F. 3d, at 607\n(Barrett, J., dissenting); see also United States v. Carpen-\nter, 80 F. 4th 790, 791 (CA6 2023) (Kethledge, J., concurring\nin denial of rehearing en banc) (\u201c[T]he act of imposing a sen-\ntence could not possibly \u2018continue up to the present\u2019\u2014be-\ncause the imposition of a sentence occurs at a fixed point in\ntime\u201d). A defendant may be sentenced, resentenced, and\nresentenced again, and at each hearing a sentence is \u201cim-\nposed\u201d even if some of those sentences are later set aside as\nlegally invalid.\n   Our cases and other provisions of Title 18 confirm that\nthe word \u201cimposed\u201d marks the historical point at which a\nsentence is pronounced regardless of whether that sentence\nhas continuing legal validity. For example, in the midst of\na discussion about plenary resentencing (a topic of particu-\nlar relevance to these cases), we once noted that \u201c[i]n re-\nmanded cases . . . trial courts have imposed a sentence on\nthe remaining counts longer than the sentence originally\nimposed on those particular counts.\u201d Greenlaw v. United\nStates, 554 U. S. 237, 253 (2008) (emphasis added). In an-\nother case, a joint opinion of the Court noted that the \u201cdeath\n\f8                 HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsentences imposed for armed robbery, however, were va-\ncated.\u201d Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 161\u2013162 (1976)\n(opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (emphasis\nadded). In both instances, our use of \u201cimposed\u201d signified\nonly that a court had, at some point in time, pronounced a\nsentence. Our use of \u201cimposed\u201d could not possibly be under-\nstood to refer to the legal validity of those later-invalidated\nsentences. Further, in other parts of Title 18, Congress\nuses \u201cimposed\u201d to signify the historical fact of a sentence,\nnot its continuing legal validity. See, e.g., \u00a73742(a)(2) (al-\nlowing a defendant to appeal \u201can otherwise final sentence\nif the sentence . . . was imposed as a result of an incorrect\napplication of the sentencing guidelines\u201d); \u00a73742(f )(1) (em-\npowering courts of appeals to remand on a finding that \u201cthe\nsentence was imposed in violation of law\u201d). I see no reason\nto think Congress intended a different meaning of \u201cim-\nposed\u201d in another provision of Title 18.\n   Additional support for the historical-fact interpretation is\nfound in Congress\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ca sentence.\u201d The\nword \u201ca\u201d is an \u201cindefinite article\u201d that \u201cpoints to a non-\nspecific object, thing, or person that is not distinguished\nfrom the other members of a class.\u201d B. Garner, Modern\nEnglish Usage 1195 (5th ed. 2022) (Modern English Usage).\n\u201cWhen used as an indefinite article, \u2018a\u2019 means \u2018[s]ome unde-\ntermined or unspecified particular.\u2019 \u201d McFadden v. United\nStates, 576 U. S. 186, 191 (2015) (quoting Webster\u2019s New\nInternal Dictionary 1 (2d ed. 1954)). In that sense, Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the indefinite article lends a broad construc-\ntion to the word \u201csentence,\u201d as if to say \u201cany sentence\u201d ever\nimposed, including a later-vacated sentence. In conjunction\nwith the word \u201cimposed,\u201d the phrase \u201ca sentence\u201d thus puts\nthe statutory focus on the existence of any kind of sentence\npronounced in the record, regardless of that sentence\u2019s pre-\nsent legal status.\n   Indeed, contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, the word \u201csen-\ntence\u201d does not ineluctably mean a \u201clegally valid\u201d sentence.\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)             9\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nOur own cases prove the point because we have often found\nit necessary to clarify whether a sentence is valid or invalid.\nSee, e.g., Swarthout v. Cooke, 562 U. S. 216, 220 (2011) (per\ncuriam) (\u201cThere is no right under the Federal Constitution\nto be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid\nsentence\u201d (emphasis added)); Pollard v. United States, 352\nU. S. 354, 357, 360 (1957) (\u201cThe only sentence that was en-\ntered at the 1952 hearing was the one of probation, admit-\ntedly invalid because of petitioner\u2019s absence\u201d (emphasis\nadded)); Richmond v. Lewis, 506 U. S. 40, 43 (1992) (\u201c[P]eti-\ntioner\u2019s conviction was found valid but his sentence invalid\u201d\n(emphasis added)); see also Uriarte, 975 F. 3d, at 607 (Bar-\nrett, J., dissenting) (\u201cThat is why it is perfectly coherent to\ndescribe the procedural posture of a case by saying, \u2018a sen-\ntence was imposed last year, but it has since been vacated\non appeal\u2019 \u201d). If Congress sought to narrow \u201ca sentence\u201d in\na specialized way to indicate a legally valid sentence, it\ncould have referred to \u201ca final sentence,\u201d \u201ca legally valid\nsentence,\u201d or more prosaically, \u201cthe sentence.\u201d Accord,\nUnited States v. Hernandez, 107 F. 4th 965, 969 (CA11\n2024).\n   Reading the retroactivity provision in context, the phrase\n\u201ca sentence has not been imposed\u201d most straightforwardly\nmeans that a district court has not, as a matter of historical\nfact, sentenced a defendant for his \u00a7924(c) offenses before\nthe Act\u2019s \u201cdate of enactment.\u201d So how can the Court read\nthe same text to refer to a presently valid sentence, rather\nthan one that was historically \u201cimposed\u201d in the past? See\nante, at 10. Bizarrely, the Court\u2019s analysis begins and ends\nwith Congress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense. Through\nthe use of a single hypothetical, which does not resemble\nthe structure of the provision actually before us, the Court\ndraws the conclusion that \u201cthe present-perfect tense con-\nveys to a listener that the event in question continues to be\ntrue or valid.\u201d Ante, at 8. But, as I have explained, the\n\f10                    HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\npresent-perfect tense is, as a general matter, capable of sup-\nporting either the historical-fact or legal-validity interpre-\ntation. The surrounding context and the specific words\nCongress employed indicate how the present-perfect tense\nmay support one interpretation or the other. As to the ac-\ntual words in the retroactivity provision (\u201cimposed,\u201d \u201ca sen-\ntence\u201d), the Court\u2019s textual analysis in Part III\u2013A is silent.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Court\u2019s legal-validity interpretation also rests on the mistaken\n\npremise that the past-perfect tense best captures the historical-fact in-\nterpretation. The Court claims \u201cif an event is merely a relic of history\nbecause it was voided by a subsequent action, the past-perfect (not the\npresent-perfect) tense would usually be the more appropriate verb\nchoice.\u201d Ante, at 8. I hope readers do not look to this Court as an author-\nity on English grammar because this broad pronouncement is badly mis-\ntaken. As support for its grammatical rule, the Court offers a hypothet-\nical: suppose a U. S. Olympic Committee rule says that \u201cathletes may\ncall themselves Olympic champions if a gold medal \u2018has been awarded\u2019\nto them.\u201d Ante, at 7. If the Olympic gold medalist is stripped of her\nmedal, however, the Court claims she can no longer call herself an\n\u201cOlympic champion\u201d under the rule. To enable our athlete to still call\nherself an Olympic champion based on her now-stripped medal, the\nCourt tells us \u201cthe past-perfect\u201d tense would be \u201cmore appropriate\u201d (e.g.,\n\u201cshe had been awarded such a medal\u201d). Ante, at 8\u20139. That is highly\ndebatable.\n   The only lesson taught by the Court\u2019s example is that the meaning of\nlanguage is heavily dependent on context. The obvious purpose of the\nhypothetical rule is to restrict the class of individuals who are entitled to\nthe honor of calling themselves Olympic champions, and the Court pre-\nsumes that the athlete in question lost her medal because she engaged\nin improper conduct, e.g., taking performance-enhancing drugs. But sup-\npose the medal was taken away for an illegitimate reason. Some histo-\nrians think that Jim Thorpe, a legendary Native American athlete who\ndominated the 1912 Olympics, was stripped of his medals at least in part\nbecause of racism. See B. Crawford, All American: The Rise and Fall of\nJim Thorpe 209\u2013210 (2005); J. Elfers, The Tour To End All Tours: the\nStory of Major League Baseball\u2019s 1913\u20131914 World Tour 18 (2003). That\nwas not completely undone until 2022, long after Thorpe died. See V.\nMather & T. Panja, Jim Thorpe Is Restored as Sole Winner of 1912 Olym-\npic Gold Medals, N. Y. Times, July 15, 2022. Suppose Thorpe had been\nasked: \u201cHave you ever been awarded an Olympic medal?\u201d Would he have\nbeen a liar if he answered \u201cyes\u201d? The Court seems to think so.\n\f                     Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)                    11\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nThe Court\u2019s failure to defend the legal-validity interpreta-\ntion is thus an independently fatal blow to its holding.\n                                B\n   Assuming the Court had proved up the legal-validity in-\nterpretation, it would still need to establish its \u201cvacatur\u201d\nprinciple. That is, it would still need to prove not only that\nthe Act is concerned with a sentence\u2019s continuing legal va-\nlidity up to the \u201cdate of enactment,\u201d but also that the Act\nhinges on the continuing validity of a sentence after the\ndate of enactment. The Court can prove as much only by\ninventing a \u201clegal fiction\u201d that a vacated sentence \u201cnever\noccurred.\u201d Ante, at 10. But one need only scratch the sur-\nface of this purported \u201clegal fiction\u201d to understand how thor-\noughly unpersuasive it is.\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court\u2019s \u201cvacatur\u201d principle\ndoes not exist. The Court assures us that there is a well-\nestablished principle in the criminal law that \u201cvacated\ncourt orders are void ab initio and thus lack any prospective\nlegal effect.\u201d Ibid. It derives this rule by over-reading a few\ncreative turns of phrase in our cases. See ante, at 11 (citing\nNorth Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 721 (1969) (stating\nvacatur causes a conviction to be \u201c \u2018wholly nullified and the\nslate wiped clean\u2019 \u201d); Pepper v. United States, 562 U. S. 476,\n507 (2011) (noting vacatur \u201c \u2018wipe[s] the slate clean\u2019 \u201d)). But\na more careful reading of our precedents and other provi-\nsions in Title 18 indicates that vacatur does not erase the\nhistorical fact of a previously imposed conviction or sen-\ntence. Further, even if the \u201cvacatur\u201d principle exists, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   Indeed, the Court offers no answer to the argument that the present-\nperfect tense may be properly used to refer to a past event that was later\nundone. Instead, the Court promises readers that an answer will come\nin Part IV of its opinion\u2014i.e., the portions in which only three Justices\njoin. See ante, at 8, n. 6. But this promise goes unfulfilled. Part IV\ncontains no deus ex machina to salvage the Court\u2019s interpretation; ra-\nther, Part IV throws a celebration for the First Step Act, perhaps hoping\nreaders lose sight of the text behind all the confetti.\n\f12                  HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nAct\u2019s retroactivity provision does not incorporate it.\n                                1\n    Our precedents foreclose the Court\u2019s \u201cvacatur\u201d principle.\nTake, for example, one of the cases the Court cites, Lewis v.\nUnited States, 445 U. S. 55 (1980). See ante, at 11. There,\nthe defendant challenged his conviction under a federal\nstatute prohibiting \u201c \u2018[a]ny person who . . . has been con-\nvicted by a court of the United States or of a State\u2019 \u201d from\n\u201c \u2018receiv[ing], possess[ing], or transport[ing] . . . any fire-\narm.\u2019 \u201d 445 U. S., at 56, and n. 1 (quoting 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71202(a)(1) (1970 ed.)). The defendant argued that his\npredicate state conviction was invalid because he lacked\ncounsel and that, as such, he could not be convicted as a\nfelon in possession under the federal statute. We assumed\nthat the predicate state conviction was subject to invalida-\ntion (i.e., vacatur), see 445 U. S., at 58, but we nevertheless\nupheld the felon-in-possession conviction. We reasoned\nthat the statute\u2019s \u201csweeping\u201d language, which is phrased in\nthe present-perfect tense just like the First Step Act, fo-\ncused on \u201cthe fact of a [predicate] felony conviction.\u201d Id., at\n60. At the time of his federal offense, the defendant\u2019s state\nconviction was extant and thus disabled him from firearm\npossession. Congress made \u201c[n]o exception\u201d for \u201ca person\nwhose outstanding [predicate] conviction ultimately might\nturn out to be invalid for any reason.\u201d Id., at 62. So a sub-\nsequent invalidation of his state predicate conviction due to\nhis lack of counsel would not render that conviction \u201cinvalid\nfor all purposes.\u201d Id., at 67. Lewis thus powerfully refutes\nthe Court\u2019s vacatur principle. If vacatur of the defendant\u2019s\npredicate conviction implied the conviction \u201cnever\noccurred,\u201d as the Court today insists, then his felon-in-\npossession conviction could not stand. Ante, at 10. But that\nis the very argument Lewis foreclosed.4\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 4 In responding to Lewis, the Court accidentally fires on its own posi-\n\f                      Cite as: 606 U. S. ____ (2025)                      13\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Although it supports the petitioners in this appeal, the\nUnited States also concedes (albeit sheepishly in a footnote)\nthat the Court\u2019s \u201cgeneral background legal principle that\nvacatur makes a sentence void from the start for all pur-\nposes\u201d is \u201cincorrect.\u201d Brief for United States 27, n. 4 (inter-\nnal quotation marks and alterations omitted). As it\nacknowledges, lower courts routinely follow Lewis and up-\nhold convictions despite the later vacatur of predicate of-\nfenses. See, e.g., Burrell v. United States, 384 F. 3d 22, 27\u2013\n28 (CA2 2004) (\u201c[I]t is the mere fact of [a prior] conviction\nat the time of the charged possession, not the reliability of\nthe conviction, that establishes the \u00a7922(g)(1) predicate\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Rob-\nerson, 752 F. 3d 517, 522 (CA1 2014) (upholding a convic-\ntion for failure to register as a sex offender even though the\npredicate sex offense was later vacated).\n   Moreover, as the United States also acknowledges,\nLewis\u2019s logic crosses into the constitutional context. Con-\nsider Bravo-Fernandez v. United States, 580 U. S. 5 (2016),\nin which we considered the application of issue preclusion\nunder the Double Jeopardy Clause when a jury returns in-\nconsistent verdicts. It is well established that if a jury con-\nvicts on one count but acquits on another count involving\nthe same conduct, the acquittal has no issue preclusive ef-\nfect. See id., at 13. Likewise, if a jury acquits on one count\nbut fails to reach agreement on another count, the acquittal\nhas such an effect. See id., at 13\u201314. In Bravo-Fernandez,\na jury convicted on one count but acquitted on others that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntion. The Court justifies Lewis\u2019s holding by explaining that \u201cthe defend-\nant\u2019s prior felony conviction had \u2018never been overturned\u2019\u2014i.e., vacated\u2014\nat the time he possessed the weapon.\u201d Ante, at 11, n. 8 (quoting Lewis v.\nUnited States, 445 U. S. 55, 57 (1980)). But that is precisely the point.\nLewis afforded \u201cprospective legal effect\u201d to the defendant\u2019s vacated con-\nviction by refusing to ignore the historical fact of his predicate conviction\neven after the vacatur. I see no way to reconcile that reasoning with the\nCourt\u2019s rule that a vacated sentence never \u201cretains prospective legal ef-\nfect.\u201d Ibid.\n\f14                  HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwere claimed to involve the same conduct. The conviction,\nhowever, was vacated due to \u201can unrelated legal error,\u201d and\nthe defendant argued that the Court should treat the con-\nviction as if it had never occurred and that the acquittal had\nissue preclusive effect barring reprosecution. Id., at 9. We\nrejected this argument, holding that the conviction\u2019s later\ninvalidation did not \u201cerase\u201d its historical existence for the\npurposes of issue preclusion because the vacatur did not\n\u201cbear on the factual determinations actually and neces-\nsarily made by the jury.\u201d Id., at 21 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Bravo-Fernandez thus treated the histori-\ncal fact of a later-vacated conviction as legally relevant,\nwhich is irreconcilable with the Court\u2019s \u201cvacatur\u201d principle.\n   The only \u201c \u2018unexpressed presumptio[n]\u2019 \u201d I can derive from\nour cases and those from the courts of appeals is the oppo-\nsite of the one the Court advances today. Ante, at 10 (quot-\ning Bond v. United States, 572 U. S. 844, 857 (2014)).\n                               2\n   Congress too has rejected the Court\u2019s \u201cvacatur\u201d principle.\nIn the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress \u201cse[t] forth a spe-\ncial . . . background principle\u201d that is incompatible with the\n\u201cvacatur\u201d rule invented today.

But \u00a73742(g)(1)\u2019s anti-\nvacatur rule cannot be described as a minor exception to an\notherwise widespread principle. The rule does not appear\nin some \u201clittle-used backwater\u201d of the Sentencing Reform\nAct. West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 730 (2022). Ra-\nther, it is incorporated into the default procedures that ap-\nply in every criminal sentencing.6 See \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii),\n(a)(5)(B).\n    In short, the Court\u2019s failure to \u201csho[w] that its own rule\n. . . existed as a background matter when Congress enacted\u201d\nthe First Step Act is fatal to its position. Coinbase, Inc. v.\nBielski, 599 U.

Garland, 593 U. S. 155, 160 (2021).\nOf course, we sometimes look to principles beyond the four\ncorners of a statute to understand the background against\nwhich Congress legislated. But we typically do so in dis-\ncrete situations. For example, we look to background\ncommon-law principles to fill in obvious gaps in statutes,\nsuch as a missing mens rea element in a criminal statute.\nSee, e.g., Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 619 (1994)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The portion of the opinion in which only three Justices join expresses\n\nconcern that, under the historical-fact interpretation, district judges will\nstruggle \u201cto reference, recall, and apply the superseded \u2018stacking\u2019 re-\ngime.\u201d Ante, at 19. But I have far more faith in district judges\u2019 ability to\nenforce older sentencing regimes. Indeed, district judges\u2019 familiarity\nwith 18 U. S. C. \u00a73742(g), which routinely requires them to apply obso-\nlete Sentencing Guidelines in the present, is proof positive.\n\f16                HEWITT v.

The Court points to no obvious gap in\nthe Act\u2019s retroactivity provision that could be filled with\n\u201crecognized\u201d \u201cbackground principles of construction.\u201d\nBond, 572 U.

But even\nif the matter were close, two more factors counsel against\nthe Court\u2019s rule.\n   First, the retroactivity provision\u2019s title\u2014\u201cAPPLICABILITY\nTO PENDING CASES\u201d\u2014advises against the Court\u2019s boundless\ninterpretation. \u201c[T]he title of a statute and the heading of\na section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt\nabout the meaning of a statute.\u201d Dubin v.

Here, the phrase\n\u201cPending Cases\u201d suggests Congress was concerned with the\nfinite population of defendants who, on the date of the First\nStep Act\u2019s enactment, lacked an initial sentence for \u00a7924(c)\noffenses. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 1366 (defining\n\u201cpending\u201d as \u201c[r]emaining undecided; awaiting decision\u201d);\nModern English Usage 813 (defining \u201cpending\u201d as \u201cawait-\ning an outcome\u201d). But the Court\u2019s \u201cvacatur\u201d principle would\nobliterate that closed set and refashion the retroactivity\nprovision as an open-ended entitlement for any defendant\nconvicted of multiple \u00a7924(c) offenses whose sentence is va-\ncated at any time and for any reason. That means, as the\nUnited States concedes, the \u201cuniverse\u201d of \u201cPending Cases\u201d\nwould \u201cincrease,\u201d for example, \u201canytime this Court issues a\ndecision that affects the validity of 924(c) sentences.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 49. If Congress intended the retroactivity provi-\nsion to benefit such an amorphous population that may for-\never grow in size, I seriously doubt it would have labeled\nthe Act\u2019s retroactivity provision with the phrase \u201cPending\nCases.\u201d\n   Second, the presumption against retroactivity further\nweighs against the Court\u2019s unnecessarily broad interpreta-\ntion. The Federal Saving Statute sets forth \u201can important\nbackground principle of interpretation\u201d that \u201ca new crimi-\nnal statute that \u2018repeal[s]\u2019 an older criminal statute shall\nnot change the penalties \u2018incurred\u2019 under that older statute\n\u2018unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide.\u2019 \u201d\nDorsey, 567 U. S., at 272, 274 (quoting 1 U. S. C. \u00a7109). Ac-\ncordingly, Congress may give retroactive effect to new re-\nductions in criminal penalties, but it must do so with \u201cplain\nimport\u201d or \u201cfair implication.\u201d 567 U. S., at 275 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Here, the First Step Act pro-\nvides a clear intent to rebut the presumption against retro-\nactivity as to offenders for whom a sentence \u201chas not been\nimposed.\u201d Although I believe the scope of that retroactivity\n\f18               HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ncommand is sufficiently clear for the reasons I have already\ngiven, to the extent there is any ambiguity about how far\nthe Act\u2019s retroactivity command should go, the presumption\nputs a thumb on the scale against construing the retroac-\ntivity command to its broadest extent as the Court does to-\nday.\n                               IV\n   After the Court is through with the text and nonexistent\nprinciples of vacatur, three Justices continue on for pages,\nsparing no effort, to extol the \u201cmuch-anticipated, much-\nheralded\u201d First Step Act. Ante, at 15. But what is the point\nof all this lauding? Perhaps realizing the weakness of their\ntextual argument, the three Justices think it wise to spruce\nup the opinion. They attempt to do so by asserting that\nwhen a \u201c \u2018bipartisan\u2019 \u201d \u201csupermajority\u201d of Congress passes\n\u201clandmark\u201d legislation, it intends to go big, down to the very\nlast subsection (or here, application note to a subsection).\nAnte, at 3; ante, at 15 (opinion of JACKSON, J., joined by\nSOTOMAYOR and KAGAN, JJ.). So I gather they would have\nus broadly construe every atom of the \u201clandmark\u201d First\nStep Act in a way that furthers Congress\u2019s supposedly\ngrand ambition to turn the page on \u201charsh\u201d sentencing\npractices. Ante, at 16.\n   There is no \u201clandmark\u201d canon of construction requiring\nthe Court to construe important legislation to its furthest\npossible implication. \u201c \u2018[N]o legislation pursues its purposes\nat all costs.\u2019 \u201d American Express Co. v.

See Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U. S.\n124, 151\u2013152 (2024).

That reality cautions\nagainst the precise move the Court makes today: an infer-\nence that Congress hid in an \u201cancillary\u201d and intentionally\ncircumscribed provision a retroactivity command that\nwould \u201calter the fundamental details\u201d of how \u00a7924(c) sen-\ntencing should work for all time. Whitman v. American\nTrucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001).\n   The three-Justice opinion rattles off the public criticisms\nthat supposedly spurred Congress to reform the practice of\n\u00a7924(c) sentence \u201cstacking.\u201d But this discussion is beside\nthe point. Nothing in this multi-page discussion sheds light\non how Members of Congress understood the retroactivity\nprovision before us.\n   Carried away with its enthusiasm for the changes ef-\nfected by the First Step Act, the three Justices bestow an\nentirely undeserved windfall on the actual petitioners in\nthese cases. Due to the especially violent nature of their\nrobberies,7 petitioners were convicted of more than a dozen\n\u00a7924(c) offenses, about half of which were not predicated on\n\u00a7924(c)\u2019s residual clause.\n   In 2019 we decided Davis and provided a basis to set\naside petitioners\u2019 \u00a7924(c) convictions under the residual\nclause, but Davis did nothing to disturb petitioners\u2019 other\n\u00a7924(c) convictions and associated mandatory-minimum\nsentences.

July 30, 2009); see FBI, Scarecrow Bandit Leader\nSentenced to 355 Years in Federal Prison on Bank Robbery and Firearms\nConvictions (May 5, 2010). During the robberies, the Scarecrow Bandits\nheld bank employees and customers at gunpoint and physically as-\nsaulted them with firearms and stun guns. See 2009 WL 2356156, *1.\nIn total, the conspiracy stole more than $350,000 before authorities\ncaught up with them. See Brief for United States 7.\n\f20                   HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nof the counts of conviction,\u201d a court, \u201cin such instances, may\nvacate the entire sentence on all counts\u201d and \u201creconfigure\nthe sentencing plan\u201d in toto. Greenlaw, 554 U. S., at 253\n(emphasis added).8 But, as petitioners\u2019 counsel conceded,\ncourts are under \u201cno obligation\u201d to follow this convention\nand may instead choose to vacate only those parts of the\nsentence related to an intervening change in law. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 15. Nor does this strike me as a case in which full\nvacatur was warranted. Section 924(c) convictions must\nrun consecutively \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii). So \u00a7924(c) sentences are presumably eas-\nier to identify and extract from a defendant\u2019s total term of\nimprisonment, often obviating the need for a plenary resen-\ntencing. The likely unnecessary vacatur of each petitioner\u2019s\nentire sentence was thus a stroke of good fortune that\nopened the door to petitioners\u2019 First Step Act claims.9 The\nlower courts (correctly) rejected those efforts, but petition-\ners have found a sympathetic audience in this Court. The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The chief reason for vacating perfectly valid convictions in such cases\n\nis to allow the sentencing court to consider whether the sentence previ-\nously imposed on a valid count provides sufficient punishment for the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct. See Greenlaw, 554 U. S., at 253\u2013254. Suppose a\ndefendant is convicted of two offenses, each with a 5-year mandatory\nminimum. The sentencing judge, thinking that the appropriate punish-\nment for the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct is 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, im-\nposes a 5-year term of imprisonment on both counts and runs the counts\nconsecutively. If one of the counts of conviction is reversed and the case\nis remanded, the sentencing judge may wish to enlarge the initial 5-year\nsentence on the remaining count to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. So the de-\nfendant \u201cultimately may gain nothing from his limited success on ap-\npeal.\u201d Id., at 254. It is therefore ironic that the unnecessary vacatur of\npetitioners\u2019 valid convictions has given them a benefit.\n   9 The District Court\u2019s willingness to vacate petitioners\u2019 entire sen-\n\ntences appears to have been informed by the position of the United\nStates, which \u201cagreed\u201d with petitioners that the \u201csentences on all re-\nmaining counts should be vacated.\u201d Agreed Order in No. 3:08\u2013cr\u2013167\n(ND Tex., Nov. 2, 2021), ECF Doc. 700, p. 2 (Ross); see Agreed Order in\nNo. 3:08\u2013cr\u2013167 (June 14, 2021), ECF Doc. 672, p. 2 (Duffey); Agreed Or-\nder in No. 3:08\u2013cr\u2013167 (Aug. 19, 2021), ECF Doc. 683, p. 2 (Hewitt).\n\f                  Cite as: 606 U.

S. C. \u00a7924</span><pre class=\"inline\">(c)\u2014a law that criminalizes possessing a firearm while\n  committing other crimes\u2014to \u201cstacked\u201d 25-year periods of incarcera-\n  tion. The First Step Act eliminated this harsh mandatory minimum\n  penalty. Section 403(b) of the Act also made its more lenient penalties\n  partially retroactive. Specifically, if a sentence \u201chas not been imposed\u201d\n  upon an eligible \u00a7924(c) offender as of the date of the First Step Act\u2019s\n  enactment, the Act applies. The question presented here concerns an\n  edge case: What penalties apply when a \u00a7924(c) offender had been sen-\n  tenced as of the Act\u2019s enactment, but that sentence was subsequently\n  vacated, such that the offender must face a post-Act resentencing?\n     In 2009, petitioners Tony Hewitt, Corey Duffey, and Jarvis Ross\n  were convicted of multiple counts of bank robbery and conspiracy to\n  commit bank robbery, along with corresponding \u00a7924(c) offenses for\n  use of a firearm during a crime of violence. Each petitioner received a\n  mandatory 5-year sentence for his first \u00a7924(c) count of conviction and,\n  despite being first-time offenders, each received 25-year mandatory\n  sentences on every \u00a7924(c) count beyond his first. Thus, each peti-\n  tioner\u2019s sentence exceeded 325 years. Petitioners successfully chal-\n  lenged some of their convictions on direct appeal, and the Fifth Circuit\n  vacated petitioners\u2019 sentences. In 2012, the District Court resentenced\n  each petitioner to between 285 and 305 years on the counts that re-\n  mained.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   *Together with No. 23\u20131150, Duffey et al. v.

See United States v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">588 U. S. 445</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n    470. Because that holding potentially affected some of petitioners\u2019 re-\n    maining convictions, the Fifth Circuit granted petitioners authoriza-\n    tion to file a second or successive postconviction motion. The District\n    Court then vacated the impacted \u00a7924(c) convictions, as well as peti-\n    tioners\u2019 sentences. When the District Court held resentencings for the\n    remaining convictions, petitioners argued that the First Step Act\u2019s 5-\n    year\u2014not 25-year\u2014mandatory minimum penalties applied. Petition-\n    ers argued they were entitled to retroactive application of the Act\u2019s\n    more lenient penalties because a vacated prior sentence is not a sen-\n    tence that \u201chas . . . been imposed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7403(b). The District\n    Court disagreed and resentenced petitioners under the pre-Act sen-\n    tencing scheme, giving them stacked 25-year mandatory minimums\n    for each \u00a7924(c) count of conviction beyond their first. Petitioners thus\n    each received sentences of 130 years or more.\n       On appeal, petitioners and the Government agreed that the First\n    Step Act should have applied at petitioners\u2019 resentencings. The Fifth\n    Circuit denied their joint request for vacatur.

Congress employed the present-perfect tense, requiring eval-\n  uation of whether \u201ca sentence . . . has . . . been imposed\u201d upon the de-\n  fendant, rather than the past-perfect tense that would exclude anyone\n  upon whom a sentence \u201chad\u201d been imposed. The present-perfect tense\n  can refer to \u201can act, state, or condition that is now completed\u201d or \u201ca\n  past action that comes up to and touches the present\u201d and thus conveys\n  that the event in question continues to be true or valid.

If an event is merely a relic of history because it was voided by a\n  subsequent action, the past-perfect (not the present-perfect) tense is\n  usually the more appropriate verb choice. The fact that adjacent pro-\n  visions of \u00a7403 contain past-tense verbs only strengthens the conclu-\n  sion that \u00a7403(b)\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense is meaningful.\n  Pp. 6\u201310.\n      (b) Background principles regarding the legal effect of vacatur con-\n  firm that a sentence has been imposed for \u00a7403(b) purposes only so\n  long as it remains valid. When interpreting statutes, the Court recog-\n  nizes that Congress legislates against the backdrop of certain unex-\n  pressed presumptions. One such presumption is that vacated court\n  orders are void ab initio and thus lack any prospective legal effect. A\n  criminal defendant whose conviction has been vacated, for example, is\n  to be treated going forward as though he were never convicted. By\n  operation of legal fiction, the law acts as though the previous convic-\n  tion never occurred. Section 403(b) reflects this commonsense under-\n  standing of background vacatur principles. Just as defendants with\n  vacated prior felony convictions are not precluded from possessing\n  weapons under the federal felon-in-possession ban, \u00a7403(b) retroactiv-\n  ity does not exclude from its scope those whose prior sentences were\n  vacated. By authorizing retroactive application of the First Step Act\u2019s\n  more lenient penalties on any eligible offender upon whom \u201ca sentence\n  . . . has not been imposed,\u201d the text of \u00a7403(b) indicates that only past\n  sentences with continued validity preclude application of the Act\u2019s new\n  penalties.

Id., at 5221\u2013\n5222 (capitalization deleted). Abrogating this Court\u2019s deci-\nsion in Deal, the statute established instead that, for first-\ntime offenders, 5-year mandatory minimums apply to each\ncount of conviction.\n  The First Step Act also addressed the potential for retro-\nactive application of this penalty reduction, by specifically\nidentifying the \u00a7924(c) offenders to whom the Act applied.\nOrdinarily, because judges impose sentences based on the\nstatutory penalties that exist at the time defendants com-\nmit their offenses, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1 U.

Each petitioner received a mandatory 5-year\nsentence as to their first \u00a7924(c) count of conviction.

Thus, in total, each petitioner\u2019s sentence exceeded 325\nyears. Roughly 25 of those years were due to the robbery\noffenses themselves, while the rest were attributable to\nstacked \u00a7924(c) counts.\n   Petitioners successfully challenged some of their convic-\ntions on direct appeal, and the Fifth Circuit accordingly va-\ncated petitioners\u2019 sentences.2 In 2012, the District Court\nresentenced each petitioner to between 285 and 305 years\non the counts that remained\u2014sentences that the Fifth Cir-\ncuit affirmed on direct review. Petitioners also filed post-\nconviction motions under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U. S.

See United States v. Davis,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">588 U. S. 445</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470 (2019).

The District Court then vacated the impacted\n\u00a7924(c) convictions, as well as petitioners\u2019 sentences.\n   When the District Court held resentencings for the re-\nmaining convictions, petitioners argued that the First Step\nAct\u2019s 5-year\u2014not 25-year\u2014mandatory minimum penalties\napplied. Petitioners argued that they were entitled to ret-\nroactive application of the First Step Act\u2019s more lenient\npenalties because a vacated prior sentence is not a sentence\nthat \u201chas . . . been imposed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7403(b).3 The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Petitioners were initially convicted of attempted bank robbery, too.\n\nThose convictions\u2014along with the corresponding \u00a7924(c) counts\u2014were\nvacated following petitioners\u2019 successful challenges on direct appeal.

But that reframing is inconsistent with nor-\nmal understandings of the present-perfect tense, which by\ndefinition focuses on the present.7 Today, if an event is\nmerely a relic of history because it was voided by a subse-\nquent action, the past-perfect (not the present-perfect)\ntense would usually be the more appropriate verb choice.\nSee B. Garner, Modern English Usage 1082 (5th ed. 2022)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The dissent does not dispute that a sprinter who is divested of her\n\ngold medal no longer qualifies as an \u201cOlympic champion\u201d under the hy-\npothetical rule. Nor does the dissent contest that, if the Committee\nwanted such a disqualified sprinter to be able to still claim the title, it\ncould phrase the rule in the past-perfect tense to accomplish that result\n(i.e., bestowing the honorific if a gold medal \u201chad been awarded\u201d to the\nathlete). The dissent\u2019s primary response to this hypothetical is, instead,\nto zero in on \u201c[t]he obvious purpose of the hypothetical rule\u201d and to ex-\nplain that \u201cthe meaning of language is heavily dependent on context.\u201d\nPost, at 10, n. 3. Part IV of this opinion fully addresses the context of\n\u00a7403(b)\u2019s language and Congress\u2019s primary objectives for enacting that\nprovision\u2014both of which support the Court\u2019s conclusion in this case.\n   7 And, notably, there is a relevant connection to the present in the op-\n\neration of \u00a7403(b) despite that statute\u2019s express reference to the date of\nthe Act\u2019s enactment: the current occasion of the sentencing of the defend-\nant in question. Sentencing courts read statutes at the moment of their\napplication\u2014which, here, would be the moment of resentencing, not the\nmoment of enactment. From that proper vantage point, petitioners were\nnot subject to a sentence, as any previous sentence had been vacated.\n\f                  Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

Rec. S7645 (Dec. 17, 2018) (statement\nof Sen. Durbin); see also Brief for Sen. Richard J. Durbin\net al. as Amici Curiae 5\u20138 (Senators Brief ). The First Step\nAct was the much-anticipated, much-heralded fruit of their\nlabor\u2014and one that many in Congress hoped would yield\nimmediate benefits. See id., at 17.12\n                              B\n   It is noteworthy for present purposes that the statute\nCongress crafted to depart from the much-maligned \u201cstack-\ning\u201d sentencing regime did so in a two-part fashion. First,\n\u00a7403(a) eliminated 25-year stacked sentences for first-time\n\u00a7924(c) offenders. Second, \u00a7403(b) addressed the retroac-\ntivity of the \u00a7403(a) benefit in a \u201c \u2018targeted way,\u2019 \u201d so as to\nensure that judges were no longer constrained to impose 25-\nyear stacked sentences on first-time \u00a7924(c) offenders mov-\ning forward. Id., at 15 (quoting 164 Cong. Rec., at S7645\n(statement of Sen. Durbin)).\n   That second part of Congress\u2019s response\u2014the focus of the\ncases before us today\u2014was highly consequential. By dis-\nplacing the background rule that changes to sentencing\nstatutes apply only prospectively (to defendants who com-\nmit their offenses after the law\u2019s effective date), Congress\nmade clear that the First Step Act\u2019s more lenient penalties\nwere to apply to some \u201c \u2018pending\u2019 \u201d cases, too\u2014i.e., the new\npenalties would be applicable to certain defendants who\nhad committed their offenses before the First Step Act.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 The dissent agrees that our job is to \u201cinterpret what Congress meant\u201d\n\nby the words in \u00a7403(b). Post, at 4. Here, Congress\u2019s desire to change\nthe derided, draconian sentencing stacking scheme Deal had created\ncould not be clearer. Thus, far from \u201cmarch[ing] in the parade of sen-\ntencing reform,\u201d post, at 2, we are merely observing the events and cir-\ncumstances that led Congress to take up the banner of sentencing reform\nitself.\n\f16                HEWITT v.

Per\n\u00a7403(b), any defendant who still needed to be sentenced as\nof the First Step Act\u2019s effective date would receive the Act\u2019s\nmore lenient penalties. Thus, as a practical matter, judges\nwould no longer have to impose harsh \u201cstacked\u201d sentences\nupon first-time \u00a7924(c) offenders.\n   Notably, because \u00a7403(b) retroactivity was only partial, it\ndiffered substantially from the full retroactivity Congress\nemployed with respect to other kinds of penalty changes it\ninstituted in the First Step Act.

See, e.g.,\nSentencing Reform Act of 2015, H. R. 3713, 114th Cong., 2d\nSess., \u00a75(b)(2), pp. 14\u201316 (2016) (providing for reduced\nterms of imprisonment in \u201ccertain past cases\u201d (capitaliza-\ntion and italics deleted)); Sentencing Reform and Correc-\ntions Act of 2017, S. 1917, 115th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7104(b)(2),\npp. 13\u201315 (2017) (permitting \u201csentence reduction\u201d for cer-\ntain \u201cpast cases\u201d (capitalization deleted)).

Under this view, First Step Act sen-\ntencing benefits apply to all first-time \u00a7924(c) offenders\nsentenced after the Act\u2019s enactment date (whether it is an\ninitial sentencing or a resentencing). This means that\n\u00a7403(b)\u2019s retroactivity line falls between those past \u00a7924(c)\noffenders with final sentences that are still in effect, on the\none hand, and those who still need to be sentenced for their\n\u00a7924(c) offense, on the other. The former are stuck with\ntheir old sentences, for finality reasons, while the latter are\neligible for First Step Act benefits at resentencing, since\nthey have to be sentenced regardless.\n   Under amicus and the dissent\u2019s reading, however, there\nexists a further line of division within the group of offenders\nwho currently lack a sentence\u2014separating those who have\nbeen sentenced previously for the \u00a7924(c) offense at issue\nfrom those who have not. For individuals in the former\ncamp, per amicus and the dissent, a judge must return to\nthe superseded sentencing scheme and impose stacked 25-\nyear sentences when such defendants are resentenced.\n   Carving up the yet-to-be-sentenced group of offenders in\nthis way does not reflect Congress\u2019s intent. See Senators\nBrief 17 (a bipartisan group of Senators, explaining that\n\f18               HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of JACKSON, J.\n\n\u201c[t]he considerations animating the First Step Act\u2019s enact-\nment undermine any suggestion that Congress intention-\nally excluded from Section 403\u2019s reach pre-Act offenders\nwhose sentences are invalid as a matter of law\u201d). Nor does\nit comport with the statutory scheme that Congress en-\nacted, for two primary reasons.\n   First, the text and context of \u00a7403(b) do not support dif-\nferentiating between \u00a7924(c) offenders on the mere basis of\nthe historical fact of a past sentencing (as we explained in\nPart III, supra), and, frankly, it is not clear what distin-\nguishing between previously sentenced and never-before-\nsentenced offenders would accomplish. The prior imposi-\ntion of a sentence does not bear on finality; if the offender\ncurrently lacks a sentence, then a court will have to resen-\ntence the defendant in any event. And though it would\nmake sense to draw the line as amicus and the dissent do if\nthe prior imposition of a sentence helped judges to more ac-\ncurately identify serious first-time \u00a7924(c) offenders\u2014po-\ntentially justifying the harsh and outdated stacked penal-\nties that the First Step Act supplanted\u2014nothing in the\nlegislative record suggests this is so. Stated simply: The\ndistinction between previously sentenced defendants and\nthose who have never been sentenced before seems to make\nno difference in terms of the retroactivity aims of the stat-\nute.\n   By contrast, requiring judges to impose Deal-era stacked\n\u00a7924(c) sentences at resentencings runs headlong into the\nanimating aims of the First Step Act. See Miller v. French,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9433979\"><a href=\"/opinion/118378/miller-v-french/#341\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Miller v. French\">530 U.

Requiring that kind of reversion prevents\njudges from uniformly moving past Deal, which was the pri-\nmary point of Congress\u2019s enactment of \u00a7403.\n   Second, the reading of \u00a7403(b) that we adopt today is\nplainly more administrable than the one amicus and the\ndissent offer. Amicus argues that his interpretation is easy\nto apply, because a district judge only needs to know\nwhether a prior sentence had ever been imposed upon the\ndefendant for the relevant offense. But that knowledge is\nnot enough\u2014the sentencing judge would still need to refer-\nence, recall, and apply the superseded \u201cstacking\u201d regime, if\napplicable. And there is a much more straightforward way\nto administer \u00a7403(b): From the Act\u2019s enactment date on-\nward, sentencing judges impose the First Step Act\u2019s less-\nened mandatory minimums for any first-time \u00a7924(c) of-\nfender\u2014full stop. This reading of \u00a7403(b) requires no\nadditional effort on the part of the judge to track down a\ndefendant\u2019s sentencing history or to confirm what manda-\ntory minimums previously governed. And it allows district\njudges to treat all first-time \u00a7924(c) defendants who appear\nbefore them for sentencing in an equitable manner that\nminimizes sentencing disparities, consistent with Con-\ngress\u2019s sentencing directives.\n                         *    *    *\n   Under the interpretation of \u00a7403(b) we adopt today, all\nfirst-time \u00a7924(c) offenders who appear for sentencing after\nthe First Step Act\u2019s enactment date\u2014including those whose\nprevious \u00a7924(c) sentences have been vacated and who thus\nneed to be resentenced\u2014are subject to the Act\u2019s revised\npenalties. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary reading of \u00a7403(b) is\nreversed, and its judgment in these cases is remanded for\nfurther proceedings.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

Decided June 26, 2025\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS, JUSTICE\nKAVANAUGH, and JUSTICE BARRETT join, dissenting.\n   In the First Step Act of 2018, Congress reduced the\nmandatory-minimum sentence for certain firearm offenses.\nLike all changes to sentencing law, this amendment applies\nprospectively. But Congress also thought it wise to apply\nthe amendment to \u201cPending Cases.\u201d Of course, \u201cPending\nCases\u201d does not mean \u201cAll Cases,\u201d and Congress limited the\nretroactive reach of the amendment to defendants for whom\n\u201ca sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of [the\nAct\u2019s] date of enactment.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">132 Stat. 5222</span><pre class=\"inline\">. In other words,\nthe amendment applies retroactively only if the defendant\nhad yet to be sentenced when Congress passed the Act in\n2018. Petitioners, who were sentenced in 2010, do not come\nclose to meeting that test.\n   Today, the Court disfigures the Act in order to reach a\ndifferent result. Its interpretation relies on two necessary\npremises. First, the Court insists that what Congress re-\nally meant to say is that the amendment applies retroac-\ntively unless \u201ca legally valid sentence\u201d is in force on the\nAct\u2019s date of enactment. Second, to get around the fact that\npetitioners did have \u201clegally valid\u201d sentences when the Act\n\f2                 HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwas passed, the Court invents a novel \u201cvacatur\u201d principle.\nThe Court tells us that the 2022 vacatur of petitioners\u2019 sen-\ntences rendered those sentences legal nullities from their\ninception. The Court\u2019s interpretation thus unspools the\nAct\u2019s carefully wound retroactivity command to mean that\nany defendant whose sentence is vacated at any time and\nfor any reason may claim the benefit of the Act\u2019s reduced\nmandatory minimum. But nothing in the text or broader\ncontext supports such a boundless interpretation. Indeed,\nthe portions of today\u2019s decision that command the votes of\nonly three Justices give the game away. Animating the\nCourt\u2019s atextual interpretation is a thinly veiled desire to\nmarch in the parade of sentencing reform. But our role is\nto interpret the statute before us, not overhaul criminal\nsentencing.\n                               I\n   Sixteen years ago, a jury convicted petitioners Corey\nDuffey, Tony Hewitt, and Jarvis Ross of multiple </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 U.

See United States v.\nReece, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">938 F. 3d 630</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 635 (2019). Seeking to take advantage\nof these fortuitous developments, petitioners successfully\nmoved to set aside some, though not all, of their \u00a7924(c) con-\nvictions that were predicated on the residual clause. Alt-\nhough the District Court could have vacated petitioners\u2019\nsentences for only those invalid \u00a7924(c) counts, petitioners\ncaught yet another lucky break. The District Court opted\n\f4                 HEWITT v.

Petitioners now try to\npush their luck even further, contending that the District\nCourt should apply the First Step Act\u2019s reduced mandatory\nminimum for their remaining \u00a7924(c) counts.\n                                II\n  As all agree, petitioners\u2019 argument requires us to inter-\npret what Congress meant when it said \u201ca sentence for the\noffense has not been imposed as of [the Act\u2019s] date of enact-\nment.\u201d What first jumps out about this provision is that\nCongress used the present-perfect tense in the phrase \u201chas\nnot been imposed.\u201d The present-perfect tense \u201cdenotes an\nact, state, or condition that\u201d is either (1) \u201cnow completed\u201d or\n(2) \u201ccontinues up to the present.\u201d The Chicago Manual of\nStyle \u00a75.132, p. 268 (17th ed. 2017).\n  Context often indicates whether a speaker is using the\nformer sense of the present-perfect tense (e.g., \u201che has been\nawarded a trophy\u201d) or the latter sense of the present-perfect\ntense (e.g., \u201che has trained for a trophy for the last three\nyears\u201d). See B. Garner, The Chicago Guide to Grammar,\nUsage, and Punctuation 97 (2016). Consider the following\nexample. Suppose I ask a man passing by a courthouse,\n\u201cHas a sentence been imposed on John Smith?\u201d He could\nrespond either, \u201cYes, on July 1\u201d or \u201cYes, since July 1.\u201d The\nformer response is perhaps the more natural one, and it as-\nsumes I asked for the historical fact of Smith\u2019s sentencing\nin the indefinite past. The latter response is correct (though\nperhaps awkward), and it assumes I asked about the con-\ntinuing legal validity of Smith\u2019s sentence up to the present.\n  The First Step Act\u2019s \u201cgrammatical structure conceivably\nleaves some room for either reading,\u201d United States v.

Re-\nmarkably, however, the Court reads this requirement out of the Act en-\ntirely. The Court insists that sentencing courts should \u201cread\u201d the First\nStep Act at \u201cthe moment of resentencing,\u201d without any reference to the\nAct\u2019s enactment date.

UNITED STATES\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Realizing the Act\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense alone\ncannot help petitioners, the Court invents a novel \u201cvacatur\u201d\nprinciple to supercharge the legal-validity interpretation.\nThe Court tells us that the First Step Act incorporates the\nbackground \u201cpresumption\u201d that \u201cvacated court orders are\nvoid ab initio and thus lack any prospective legal effect.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. This revamped version of the legal-validity in-\nterpretation means that \u201ca sentence . . . has . . . been im-\nposed as of [the Act\u2019s] date of enactment\u201d if a defendant re-\nceives a legally valid sentence before the Act\u2019s passage and\nthat sentence is never, at any future time, vacated. Under\nthis view, the 2022 vacatur of petitioners\u2019 2012 sentences\nimplies that, \u201c[b]y operation of [a] legal fiction,\u201d their 2012\nsentences \u201cnever occurred\u201d and so could not have been le-\ngally valid as of the Act\u2019s enactment date. Ibid.\n   The Court\u2019s vacatur-inflected legal-validity interpreta-\ntion thus rests on two necessary premises. First, the legal-\nvalidity interpretation is superior to the historical-fact in-\nterpretation. Second, the Act incorporates the \u201cvacatur\u201d\nprinciple. If either premise falters, so does the Court\u2019s in-\nterpretation. In my view, there is little doubt that both of\nthe necessary premises fail.\n                              III\n                               A\n  To start, the most plausible reading of the retroactivity\nprovision is that \u201ca sentence . . . has . . . been imposed\u201d\nwhen, as a matter of historical fact, a district court has sen-\ntenced a defendant. Subsequent legal changes\u2014such as the\nvacatur of a previously imposed sentence\u2014do not change\nthe purely historical fact that a defendant was, at a point\nin time, actually sentenced. When the Act asks whether a\nsentence \u201chas . . . been imposed,\u201d it refers to the unchanging\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthis \u201cconvention.\u201d The Act takes the unusual steps of referencing the\ndate on which it was \u201cenacted\u201d and employing the present-perfect tense,\nnot the ordinary present tense.\n\f                   Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

In both instances, our use of \u201cimposed\u201d signified\nonly that a court had, at some point in time, pronounced a\nsentence. Our use of \u201cimposed\u201d could not possibly be under-\nstood to refer to the legal validity of those later-invalidated\nsentences. Further, in other parts of Title 18, Congress\nuses \u201cimposed\u201d to signify the historical fact of a sentence,\nnot its continuing legal validity. See, e.g., \u00a73742(a)(2) (al-\nlowing a defendant to appeal \u201can otherwise final sentence\nif the sentence . . . was imposed as a result of an incorrect\napplication of the sentencing guidelines\u201d); \u00a73742(f )(1) (em-\npowering courts of appeals to remand on a finding that \u201cthe\nsentence was imposed in violation of law\u201d). I see no reason\nto think Congress intended a different meaning of \u201cim-\nposed\u201d in another provision of Title 18.\n   Additional support for the historical-fact interpretation is\nfound in Congress\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ca sentence.\u201d The\nword \u201ca\u201d is an \u201cindefinite article\u201d that \u201cpoints to a non-\nspecific object, thing, or person that is not distinguished\nfrom the other members of a class.\u201d B. Garner, Modern\nEnglish Usage 1195 (5th ed. 2022) (Modern English Usage).\n\u201cWhen used as an indefinite article, \u2018a\u2019 means \u2018[s]ome unde-\ntermined or unspecified particular.\u2019 \u201d McFadden v.

In conjunction\nwith the word \u201cimposed,\u201d the phrase \u201ca sentence\u201d thus puts\nthe statutory focus on the existence of any kind of sentence\npronounced in the record, regardless of that sentence\u2019s pre-\nsent legal status.\n   Indeed, contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, the word \u201csen-\ntence\u201d does not ineluctably mean a \u201clegally valid\u201d sentence.\n\f                  Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.

See\nante, at 10. Bizarrely, the Court\u2019s analysis begins and ends\nwith Congress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense. Through\nthe use of a single hypothetical, which does not resemble\nthe structure of the provision actually before us, the Court\ndraws the conclusion that \u201cthe present-perfect tense con-\nveys to a listener that the event in question continues to be\ntrue or valid.\u201d Ante, at 8. But, as I have explained, the\n\f10                    HEWITT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\npresent-perfect tense is, as a general matter, capable of sup-\nporting either the historical-fact or legal-validity interpre-\ntation. The surrounding context and the specific words\nCongress employed indicate how the present-perfect tense\nmay support one interpretation or the other. As to the ac-\ntual words in the retroactivity provision (\u201cimposed,\u201d \u201ca sen-\ntence\u201d), the Court\u2019s textual analysis in Part III\u2013A is silent.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Court\u2019s legal-validity interpretation also rests on the mistaken\n\npremise that the past-perfect tense best captures the historical-fact in-\nterpretation. The Court claims \u201cif an event is merely a relic of history\nbecause it was voided by a subsequent action, the past-perfect (not the\npresent-perfect) tense would usually be the more appropriate verb\nchoice.\u201d Ante, at 8. I hope readers do not look to this Court as an author-\nity on English grammar because this broad pronouncement is badly mis-\ntaken. As support for its grammatical rule, the Court offers a hypothet-\nical: suppose a U. S. Olympic Committee rule says that \u201cathletes may\ncall themselves Olympic champions if a gold medal \u2018has been awarded\u2019\nto them.\u201d Ante, at 7. If the Olympic gold medalist is stripped of her\nmedal, however, the Court claims she can no longer call herself an\n\u201cOlympic champion\u201d under the rule. To enable our athlete to still call\nherself an Olympic champion based on her now-stripped medal, the\nCourt tells us \u201cthe past-perfect\u201d tense would be \u201cmore appropriate\u201d (e.g.,\n\u201cshe had been awarded such a medal\u201d). Ante, at 8\u20139. That is highly\ndebatable.\n   The only lesson taught by the Court\u2019s example is that the meaning of\nlanguage is heavily dependent on context. The obvious purpose of the\nhypothetical rule is to restrict the class of individuals who are entitled to\nthe honor of calling themselves Olympic champions, and the Court pre-\nsumes that the athlete in question lost her medal because she engaged\nin improper conduct, e.g., taking performance-enhancing drugs. But sup-\npose the medal was taken away for an illegitimate reason. Some histo-\nrians think that Jim Thorpe, a legendary Native American athlete who\ndominated the 1912 Olympics, was stripped of his medals at least in part\nbecause of racism. See B. Crawford, All American: The Rise and Fall of\nJim Thorpe 209\u2013210 (2005); J. Elfers, The Tour To End All Tours: the\nStory of Major League Baseball\u2019s 1913\u20131914 World Tour 18 (2003). That\nwas not completely undone until 2022, long after Thorpe died. See V.\nMather &amp; T. Panja, Jim Thorpe Is Restored as Sole Winner of 1912 Olym-\npic Gold Medals, N. Y. Times, July 15, 2022. Suppose Thorpe had been\nasked: \u201cHave you ever been awarded an Olympic medal?\u201d Would he have\nbeen a liar if he answered \u201cyes\u201d?

Here, the phrase\n\u201cPending Cases\u201d suggests Congress was concerned with the\nfinite population of defendants who, on the date of the First\nStep Act\u2019s enactment, lacked an initial sentence for \u00a7924(c)\noffenses. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 1366 (defining\n\u201cpending\u201d as \u201c[r]emaining undecided; awaiting decision\u201d);\nModern English Usage 813 (defining \u201cpending\u201d as \u201cawait-\ning an outcome\u201d). But the Court\u2019s \u201cvacatur\u201d principle would\nobliterate that closed set and refashion the retroactivity\nprovision as an open-ended entitlement for any defendant\nconvicted of multiple \u00a7924(c) offenses whose sentence is va-\ncated at any time and for any reason. That means, as the\nUnited States concedes, the \u201cuniverse\u201d of \u201cPending Cases\u201d\nwould \u201cincrease,\u201d for example, \u201canytime this Court issues a\ndecision that affects the validity of 924(c) sentences.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 49. If Congress intended the retroactivity provi-\nsion to benefit such an amorphous population that may for-\never grow in size, I seriously doubt it would have labeled\nthe Act\u2019s retroactivity provision with the phrase \u201cPending\nCases.\u201d\n   Second, the presumption against retroactivity further\nweighs against the Court\u2019s unnecessarily broad interpreta-\ntion. The Federal Saving Statute sets forth \u201can important\nbackground principle of interpretation\u201d that \u201ca new crimi-\nnal statute that \u2018repeal[s]\u2019 an older criminal statute shall\nnot change the penalties \u2018incurred\u2019 under that older statute\n\u2018unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide.\u2019 \u201d\nDorsey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9500747\"><a href=\"/opinion/802791/dorsey-v-united-states/#272\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Dorsey v.

Tr. of\nOral Arg. 15. Nor does this strike me as a case in which full\nvacatur was warranted. Section 924(c) convictions must\nrun consecutively \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii). So \u00a7924(c) sentences are presumably eas-\nier to identify and extract from a defendant\u2019s total term of\nimprisonment, often obviating the need for a plenary resen-\ntencing. The likely unnecessary vacatur of each petitioner\u2019s\nentire sentence was thus a stroke of good fortune that\nopened the door to petitioners\u2019 First Step Act claims.9 The\nlower courts (correctly) rejected those efforts, but petition-\ners have found a sympathetic audience in this Court. The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The chief reason for vacating perfectly valid convictions in such cases\n\nis to allow the sentencing court to consider whether the sentence previ-\nously imposed on a valid count provides sufficient punishment for the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct. See Greenlaw, 554 U. S., at 253\u2013254. Suppose a\ndefendant is convicted of two offenses, each with a 5-year mandatory\nminimum. The sentencing judge, thinking that the appropriate punish-\nment for the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct is 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, im-\nposes a 5-year term of imprisonment on both counts and runs the counts\nconsecutively. If one of the counts of conviction is reversed and the case\nis remanded, the sentencing judge may wish to enlarge the initial 5-year\nsentence on the remaining count to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. So the de-\nfendant \u201cultimately may gain nothing from his limited success on ap-\npeal.\u201d Id., at 254. It is therefore ironic that the unnecessary vacatur of\npetitioners\u2019 valid convictions has given them a benefit.\n   9 The District Court\u2019s willingness to vacate petitioners\u2019 entire sen-\n\ntences appears to have been informed by the position of the United\nStates, which \u201cagreed\u201d with petitioners that the \u201csentences on all re-\nmaining counts should be vacated.\u201d Agreed Order in No. 3:08\u2013cr\u2013167\n(ND Tex., Nov. 2, 2021), ECF Doc. 700, p. 2 (Ross); see Agreed Order in\nNo. 3:08\u2013cr\u2013167 (June 14, 2021), ECF Doc. 672, p. 2 (Duffey); Agreed Or-\nder in No. 3:08\u2013cr\u2013167 (Aug. 19, 2021), ECF Doc. 683, p. 2 (Hewitt).\n\f                  Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">606 U.
