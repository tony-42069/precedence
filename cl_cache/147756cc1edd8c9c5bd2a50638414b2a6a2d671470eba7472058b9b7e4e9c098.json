See 90 Fed. Reg. 10030\n(2025). The President issued Proclamation No. 10903, in-\nvoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), Rev. Stat. \u00a74067, 50\nU. S. C. \u00a721, to detain and remove Venezuelan nationals\n\u201cwho are members of TdA.\u201d Invocation of the Alien Ene-\nmies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by\nTren de Aragua, 90 Fed. Reg. 13034. Five detainees and a\nputative class sought injunctive and declaratory relief\nagainst the implementation of, and their removal under,\nthe Proclamation. Initially, the detainees sought relief in\nhabeas among other causes of action, but they dismissed\ntheir habeas claims. On March 15, 2025, the District Court\nfor the District of Columbia issued two temporary restrain-\ning orders (TROs) preventing any removal of the named\nplaintiffs and preventing removal under the AEA of a pro-\nvisionally certified class consisting of \u201c[a]ll noncitizens in\nU.S. custody who are subject to\u201d the Proclamation. Minute\nOrder on Motion To Certify Class in No. 25\u2212cv\u221200766. On\nMarch 28, the District Court extended the TROs for up to\nan additional 14 days. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 65(b)(2).\n\f2                      TRUMP v. J. G. G.\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nThe D. C. Circuit denied the Government\u2019s emergency mo-\ntion to stay the orders. The Government then applied to\nthis Court, seeking vacatur of the orders. We construe\nthese TROs as appealable injunctions. See Carson v. Amer-\nican Brands, Inc., 450 U. S. 79, 84 (1981).\n   We grant the application and vacate the TROs. The de-\ntainees seek equitable relief against the implementation of\nthe Proclamation and against their removal under the AEA.\nThey challenge the Government\u2019s interpretation of the Act\nand assert that they do not fall within the category of re-\nmovable alien enemies. But we do not reach those argu-\nments. Challenges to removal under the AEA, a statute\nwhich largely \u201c \u2018preclude[s] judicial review,\u2019 \u201d Ludecke v.\nWatkins, 335 U. S. 160, 163\u2212164, (1948), must be brought\nin habeas. Cf. Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U. S. 229, 234\u2212235\n(1953) (holding that habeas was the only cause of action\navailable to challenge deportation under immigration stat-\nutes that \u201cpreclud[ed] judicial intervention\u201d beyond what\nwas necessary to vindicate due process rights). Regardless\nof whether the detainees formally request release from con-\nfinement, because their claims for relief \u201c \u2018necessarily imply\nthe invalidity\u2019 \u201d of their confinement and removal under the\nAEA, their claims fall within the \u201ccore\u201d of the writ of habeas\ncorpus and thus must be brought in habeas. Cf. Nance v.\nWard, 597 U. S. 159, 167 (2022) (quoting Heck v. Humph-\nrey, 512 U. S. 477, 487 (1994)). And \u201cimmediate physical\nrelease [is not] the only remedy under the federal writ of\nhabeas corpus.\u201d Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54, 67 (1968); see,\ne.g., Nance, 597 U. S., at 167 (explaining that a capital pris-\noner may seek \u201cto overturn his death sentence\u201d in habeas\nby \u201canalog[y]\u201d to seeking release); In re Bonner, 151 U. S.\n242, 254, 259 (1894). For \u201ccore habeas petitions,\u201d \u201cjurisdic-\ntion lies in only one district: the district of confinement.\u201d\nRumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U. S. 426, 443 (2004). The detain-\nees are confined in Texas, so venue is improper in the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia. As a result, the Government is likely to\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U.

Although judicial review under the AEA is\nlimited, we have held that an individual subject to deten-\ntion and removal under that statute is entitled to \u201c \u2018judicial\nreview\u2019 \u201d as to \u201cquestions of interpretation and constitution-\nality\u201d of the Act as well as whether he or she \u201cis in fact an\nalien enemy fourteen years of age or older.\u201d Ludecke, 335\nU. S., at 163\u2212164, 172, n. 17. (Under the Proclamation, the\nterm \u201calien enemy\u201d is defined to include \u201call Venezuelan cit-\nizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are\nwithin the United States, and are not actually naturalized\nor lawful permanent residents of the United States.\u201d 90\nFed. Reg. 13034.) The detainees\u2019 rights against summary\nremoval, however, are not currently in dispute. The Gov-\nernment expressly agrees that \u201cTdA members subject to re-\nmoval under the Alien Enemies Act get judicial review.\u201d\nReply in Support of Application To Vacate 1. \u201cIt is well es-\ntablished that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due\nprocess of law\u201d in the context of removal proceedings. Reno\nv. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 306 (1993). So, the detainees are\nentitled to notice and opportunity to be heard \u201cappropriate\nto the nature of the case.\u201d Mullane v. Central Hanover\nBank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 313 (1950). More specifi-\ncally, in this context, AEA detainees must receive notice af-\nter the date of this order that they are subject to removal\nunder the Act. The notice must be afforded within a rea-\nsonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to\nactually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such\nremoval occurs.\n   For all the rhetoric of the dissents, today\u2019s order and per\ncuriam confirm that the detainees subject to removal orders\nunder the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to\nchallenge their removal. The only question is which court\nwill resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, we\n\f4                     TRUMP v. J. G. G.\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nhold that venue lies in the district of confinement. The dis-\nsents would have the Court delay resolving that issue, re-\nquiring\u2014given our decision today\u2014that the process begin\nanew down the road. We see no benefit in such wasteful\ndelay.\n  The application to vacate the orders of the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia presented to THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE and by him referred to the Court is\ngranted. The March 15, 2025 minute orders granting a\ntemporary restraining order and March 28, 2025 extension\nof the United States District Court for the District of Co-\nlumbia, case No. 1:25-cv-766, are vacated.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U.

Importantly,\nas the Court stresses, the Court\u2019s disagreement with the\ndissenters is not over whether the detainees receive judicial\nreview of their transfers\u2014all nine Members of the Court\nagree that judicial review is available. The only question is\nwhere that judicial review should occur. That venue\nquestion turns on whether these transfer claims belong in\nhabeas corpus proceedings or instead may be brought under\nthe Administrative Procedure Act. I agree with the Court\u2019s\nanalysis that the claims must be brought in habeas.\n  I add only that the use of habeas for transfer claims is not\nnovel. In the extradition context and with respect to\ntransfers of Guantanamo and other wartime detainees,\nhabeas corpus proceedings have long been the appropriate\nvehicle. See LoBue v. Christopher, 82 F. 3d 1081, 1082\n(CADC 1996); Kiyemba v. Obama, 561 F. 3d 509, 512\u2013513\n(CADC 2009). That general rule holds true for claims under\nthe Alien Enemies Act, the statute under which the\nGovernment is seeking to remove these detainees. See\nLudecke v. Watkins, 335 U. S. 160, 163, 171, and n. 17\n(1948).

It did so\nwithout any due process of law, under the auspices of the\nAlien Enemies Act, a 1798 law designed for times of war.\nBetween the start of these removals and now, a District\nCourt has been expeditiously considering the legal claims\nof a group of detainees (hereafter plaintiffs), who allege that\ntheir summary removal violates the Constitution and mul-\ntiple statutes. The District Court ordered a pause on plain-\ntiffs\u2019 removals until it could consider their motion for a pre-\nliminary injunction at a hearing tomorrow, on April 8. Still,\na majority of the Court sees fit to speak to this issue today.\n   Critically, even the majority today agrees, and the Fed-\neral Government now admits, that individuals subject to re-\nmoval under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to adequate\nnotice and judicial review before they can be removed. That\nshould have been the end of the matter. Yet, with \u201cbare-\nbones briefing, no argument, and scarce time for reflection,\u201d\nDepartment of Education v. California, 604 U.

G.\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n(2025) (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2), the Court an-\nnounces that legal challenges to an individual\u2019s removal un-\nder the Alien Enemies Act must be brought in habeas peti-\ntions in the district where they are detained.\n   The Court\u2019s legal conclusion is suspect. The Court inter-\nvenes anyway, granting the Government extraordinary re-\nlief and vacating the District Court\u2019s order on that basis\nalone. It does so without mention of the grave harm Plain-\ntiffs will face if they are erroneously removed to El Salvador\nor regard for the Government\u2019s attempts to subvert the ju-\ndicial process throughout this litigation. Because the Court\nshould not reward the Government\u2019s efforts to erode the\nrule of law with discretionary equitable relief, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                               I\n                              A\n   This case arises out of the President\u2019s unprecedented\npeacetime invocation of a wartime law known as the Alien\nEnemies Act. See Act of July 6, 1798, ch. 66, 1 Stat. 577.\nEnacted in 1798 by a Congress consumed with fear of war\nwith France, the Alien Enemies Act provided a wartime\ncounterpart to the widely denounced Alien Friends Act,\nwhich granted the President sweeping power to detain and\nexpel any noncitizen he deemed \u201cdangerous to the peace\nand safety of the United States.\u201d Act of June 25, 1798, 1\nStat. 571. Unlike the Alien Friends Act, which lapsed in\ndisrepute as James Madison deemed it \u201ca monster that\nmust for ever disgrace its parents,\u201d the Founders saw the\nAlien Enemies Act as a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s\npowers to \u201cdeclare War,\u201d to \u201craise and support Armies,\u201d and\nto \u201cprovide for calling forth the Militia to . . . suppress In-\nsurrections and repel Invasions.\u201d U.

Rev.\nStat. \u00a74067, 50 U. S. C. \u00a721. Before today, U. S. Presidents\nhave invoked the Alien Enemies Act only three times, each\nin the context of an ongoing war: the War of 1812, World\nWar I, and World War II.2\n  That changed on March 14, 2025, when President Trump\ninvoked the Alien Enemies Act to address an alleged \u201cInva-\nsion of the United States by Tren De Aragua,\u201d a criminal\norganization based in Venezuela. See Invocation of the Al-\nien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United\nStates by Tren de Aragua, Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed.\nReg. 13033. There is, of course, no ongoing war between the\nUnited States and Venezuela. Nor is Tren de Aragua itself\na \u201cforeign nation.\u201d \u00a721. The President\u2019s Proclamation\nnonetheless asserts that Tren de Aragua is \u201cundertaking\nhostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against\nthe territory of the United States both directly and at the\ndirection . . . of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.\u201d 90 Fed.\nReg. 13034. Based on these findings, the Proclamation de-\nclares that \u201call Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older\nwho are members of [Tren de Aragua]\u201d and are not \u201cnatu-\nralized [citizens] or lawful permanent residents\u201d are liable\nto \u201cimmediate apprehension, detention, and removal\u201d as al-\nien enemies.

President Trump did just the opposite. In what can\nbe understood only as covert preparation to skirt both the\nrequirements of the Act and the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of\ndue process, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\nbegan moving Venezuelan migrants from Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement detention centers across the country\nto the El Valle Detention Facility in South Texas before the\nPresident had even signed the Proclamation. ___ F.

The\ntransferred detainees, most of whom denied past or present\naffiliation with any gang, did not know the reason for their\ntransfer until the evening of Friday, March 14, when they\nwere apparently \u201cpulled from their cells and told that they\nwould be deported the next day to an unknown destina-\ntion.\u201d Ibid.\n                               B\n  Suspecting that the President had covertly signed a Proc-\nlamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act, several lawyers\nanticipated their clients\u2019 imminent deportation and filed a\nputative class action in the District of Columbia.

Despite knowing of plaintiffs\u2019 claim\nthat it would be unlawful to remove them under the Proc-\nlamation, the Government ushered the named plaintiffs\nonto planes along with dozens of other detainees, all with-\nout any opportunity to contact their lawyers, much less no-\ntice or opportunity to be heard.

Not until\nan hour before the District Court\u2019s scheduled hearing, and\nonly moments before the Government planned to send its\nplanes off to El Salvador, did the White House finally pub-\nlish the Proclamation on its website.\n   At its 5 p.m. hearing, the District Court provisionally cer-\ntified a class of Venezuelan noncitizens subject to the Proc-\nlamation. See Tr. 23, 25 (Mar. 15, 2025). It then issued an\noral temporary restraining order prohibiting the Govern-\nment from removing all members of the class pursuant to\nthe Proclamation for 14 days. Id., at 42. The order did not\ndisturb the Government\u2019s ability to apprehend or detain in-\ndividuals pursuant to the Proclamation or its authority to\ndeport any individual under the Immigration and Natural-\nization Act. See ibid.; see 2025 WL 890401, *1. All it re-\nquired of the Government was a pause in deportations pur-\nsuant to the Proclamation until the court had a chance to\nreview their legality.

Even now, the District Court con-\ntinues to investigate what happened via show-cause pro-\nceedings. In those proceedings, the Government took the\nposition that it had no legal obligation to obey the District\nCourt\u2019s orders directing the return of planes in flight be-\ncause they were issued from the bench. See Tr. 17 (Mar.\n17, 2025) (\u201c[O]ral statements are not injunctions\u201d). Of\ncourse, as the Government well knows, courts routinely is-\nsue rulings from the bench, and those rulings can be ap-\npealed, including to this Court, in appropriate circum-\nstances.3\n  The District Court, for its part, has surmised that \u201cthe\nGovernment knew as of 10 a.m. on March 15 that the Court\nwould hold a hearing later that day,\u201d yet it \u201chustled people\nonto those planes in hopes of evading an injunction or per-\nhaps preventing [individuals] from requesting the habeas\nhearing to which the Government now acknowledges they\nare entitled.\u201d 2025 WL 890401, *5. Rather than turn\naround the planes that were in the air when the Court is-\nsued its order, moreover, the Federal Government landed\nthe planes full of alleged Venezuelan nationals in El Salva-\ndor and transferred them directly into El Salvador\u2019s Center\nfor Terrorism Confinement (CECOT). Ibid.\n  Deportation directly into CECOT presented a risk of ex-\ntraordinary harm to these Plaintiffs. The record reflects\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See, e.g., United States v.

One\nscholar attests that an estimated 375 detainees have died\nin Salvadoran prisons since March 2022. Ibid.\n  What if the Government later determines that it sent one\nof these detainees to CECOT in error? Or a court eventu-\nally decides that the President lacked authority under the\nAlien Enemies Act to declare that Tren de Aragua is perpe-\ntrating or attempting an \u201cinvasion\u201d against the territory of\nthe United States? The Government takes the position\nthat, even when it makes a mistake, it cannot retrieve indi-\nviduals from the Salvadoran prisons to which it has sent\nthem.

Not\ncontent to wait until tomorrow, when the District Court will\nhave a chance to consider full preliminary injunction brief-\ning at a scheduled hearing, this Court intervenes to relieve\nthe Government of its obligation under the order.\n                              II\n  Begin with that upon which all nine Members of this\nCourt agree. The Court\u2019s order today dictates, in no uncer-\ntain terms, that \u201cindividual[s] subject to detention and re-\nmoval under the [Alien Enemies Act are] entitled to \u2018judicial\nreview\u2019 as to \u2018questions of interpretation and constitution-\nality\u2019 of the Act as well as whether he or she \u2018is in fact an\nalien enemy fourteen years of age or older.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 2\n(quoting Ludecke v.

C. \u00a721, and ask, for\nexample, whether any given individual is in fact a member\nof Tren de Aragua. Even the Government has now largely\nconceded that point. Application 19.\n   So too do we all agree with the per curiam\u2019s command\nthat the Fifth Amendment requires the Government to af-\nford plaintiffs \u201cnotice after the date of this order that they\nare subject to removal under the Act, . . . within reasonable\ntime and in such a manner as will allow them to actually\nseek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal\noccurs.\u201d Ante, at 3. That means, of course, that the Gov-\nernment cannot usher any detainees, including plaintiffs,\nonto planes in a shroud of secrecy, as it did on March 15,\n2025. Nor can the Government \u201cimmediately resume\u201d re-\nmoving individuals without notice upon vacatur of the TRO,\nas it promised the D. C. Circuit it would do. See 2025 WL\n914682, *13 (Millett, J., concurring) (referencing oral argu-\nment before that court). To the extent the Government re-\nmoves even one individual without affording him notice and\na meaningful opportunity to file and pursue habeas relief,\nit does so in direct contravention of an edict by the United\nStates Supreme Court.\n                               III\n  In light of this agreement, the Court\u2019s decision to inter-\nvene in this litigation is as inexplicable as it is dangerous.\nRecall that, when the District Court issued its temporary\nrestraining order on March 15, 2025, the Government was\nengaged in a covert operation to deport dozens of immi-\ngrants without notice or an opportunity for hearings. The\nCourt\u2019s ruling today means that those deportations violated\nthe Due Process Clause\u2019s most fundamental protections.\nSee ante, at 3 (reiterating that notice and an opportunity\nfor a hearing are required before a deportation under the\nAlien Enemies Act). The District Court rightly intervened\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U.

S. Government\u2019s unprece-\ndented deportation of dozens of immigrants to a foreign\nprison without due process, a majority of this Court sees fit\nto vacate the District Court\u2019s order. The reason, appar-\nently, is that the majority thinks plaintiffs\u2019 claims should\nhave been styled as habeas actions and filed in the districts\nof their detention. In reaching that result, the majority\nflouts well-established limits on its jurisdiction, creates\nnew law on the emergency docket, and elides the serious\nthreat our intervention poses to the lives of individual de-\ntainees.\n                                A\n   As an initial matter, the Court lacks jurisdiction to re-\nview the District Court\u2019s time-limited, interlocutory order.\nIt is well established that, generally, \u201ctemporary restrain-\ning orders are not appealable.\u201d 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, &\nE. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73922.1, p. 90\n(3d ed. 2012). That rule is a general one because it gives\nway where a temporary restraining order risks imposing\nsuch an \u201c \u2018irreparable . . . consequence\u2019 \u201d that an immediate\nappeal is necessary if the order is to be \u201c \u2018effectually chal-\nlenged\u2019 \u201d at all. Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U. S.\n79, 84 (1981).\n   Here, the District Court ordered a 14-day halt on depor-\ntations pursuant to the Proclamation (extended once for 14\nadditional days) because it thought the plaintiffs were\nlikely entitled to \u201cindividualized hearings to determine\nwhether the Act applies to them at all.\u201d 2025 WL 890401,\n*2. The Government now admits that it must provide de-\ntainees with adequate notice, and it says they can then file\nhabeas petitions in the Southern District of Texas to contest\n\f12                     TRUMP v. J. G. G.\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nand stay their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. Such\nproceedings, if adequately provided, necessarily mean that\nthe Government cannot imminently deport the Plaintiffs\nunder the Proclamation. So it is hard to see why the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s temporary restraining order (of which only five\ndays now remain) presented the Government with an emer-\ngency of any kind, much less one that required an immedi-\nate appeal.\n                                 B\n    Also troubling is this Court\u2019s decision to vacate summar-\nily the District Court\u2019s order on the novel ground that an\nindividual\u2019s challenge to his removal under the Alien Ene-\nmies Act \u201cfall[s] within the \u2018core\u2019 of the writ of habeas cor-\npus\u201d and must therefore be filed where the plaintiffs are de-\ntained. Ante, at 2. The Court reaches that conclusion\nwithout oral argument or the benefit of percolation in the\nlower courts, and with just a few days of deliberation based\non barebones briefing.\n    This conclusion is dubious. As an initial matter, the ma-\njority\u2019s assertion that plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201csound\u201d in habeas is\nin tension with this Court\u2019s understanding of habeas corpus\nas, at its core, an avenue for a person in custody to \u201cattack\n. . . the legality of that custody\u201d and \u201cto secure release from\nillegal custody.\u201d Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 484\n(1973). The plaintiffs in this case sued not to challenge\ntheir detention, but to protect themselves from summary\ndeportation pursuant to the Proclamation. Indeed, because\nall of the plaintiffs were already in immigration detention\nunder other statutes when the Government subjected them\nto the Proclamation, they \u201chave repeatedly emphasized\nthroughout this litigation that they \u2018do not seek release\nfrom custody\u2019 \u201d and are not \u201ccontesting the validity of their\nconfinement or seeking to shorten its duration.\u201d 2025 WL\n890401, *8.\n    Nevertheless, the majority insists that plaintiffs\u2019 claims\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U.

Ante, at 2. It\ntherefore analogizes this case to the line of cases beginning\nwith Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), where the\nCourt held that individuals serving state criminal sen-\ntences cannot bring 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 suits to complain of\n\u201cunconstitutional treatment at the hands of state officials\u201d\nif a judgment in their favor would \u201cnecessarily imply the\ninvalidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d 512 U. S., at 480,\n487. In such cases, habeas is the exclusive avenue for relief.\nIbid. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, however, do not \u201cimply the invalid-\nity of \u201d their detention, because their detention predated the\nProclamation and was unrelated to the Alien Enemies Act.\nThus, if they succeeded in showing that they could not be\nremoved under the Proclamation, that would not result in\ntheir release from detention. Even in the context of \u00a71983\nchallenges by criminal defendants, this Court has never\n\u201crecognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available\none, where the relief sought would \u2018neither terminate cus-\ntody, accelerate the future date of release from custody, nor\nreduce the level of custody.\u2019 \u201d Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U. S.\n521, 534 (2011) (brackets omitted).\n   There is also good reason to doubt that Heck\u2019s holding\nabout the availability of relief under \u00a71983 extends to Ad-\nministrative Procedure Act (APA) claims challenging exec-\nutive action under the Alien Enemies Act. The Heck bar\narose from the Court reading an \u201c \u2018implicit exception\u2019 \u201d into\n\u00a71983 to avoid \u201cswamping the habeas statute\u2019s coverage of\nclaims that the prisoner is \u2018in custody in violation of the\nConstitution.\u2019 \u201d Nance v. Ward, 597 U. S. 159, 167 (2022)\n(quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(a)). This Court has never limited\nthe availability of APA relief so narrowly. To the contrary,\nthe APA has long been available to plaintiffs absent specific\npreclusion by Congress. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,\n387 U. S. 136, 141 (1967).\n\f14                    TRUMP v. J. G. G.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Although the APA allows courts to review only agency ac-\ntion \u201cfor which there is no other adequate remedy in a\ncourt,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7704, this Court has long read that limi-\ntation narrowly, emphasizing that it \u201cshould not be con-\nstrued to defeat the central purpose of providing a broad\nspectrum of judicial review of agency action.\u201d Bowen v.\nMassachusetts, 487 U. S. 879, 903 (1988); see also Darby v.\nCisneros, 509 U. S. 137, 146 (1993) (\u201cCongress intended by\nthat provision simply to avoid duplicating previously estab-\nlished special statutory procedures for review of agency ac-\ntions\u201d). Indeed, in the mid-20th century, this Court repeat-\nedly said that habeas and APA actions were both available\nto noncitizens challenging their deportation orders. See\nBrownell v. Tom We Shung, 352 U. S. 180, 181 (1956)\n(\u201c[E]ither remedy is available in seeking review of [depor-\ntation] orders\u201d); see also Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U. S.\n48, 50\u201351 (1955) (allowing for judicial review of a deporta-\ntion order under the APA).\n   Against that backdrop, there is every reason to question\nthe majority\u2019s hurried conclusion that habeas relief sup-\nplies the exclusive means to challenge removal under the\nAlien Enemies Act. At the very least, the question is a\nthorny one, and this emergency application was not the\nplace to resolve it. Nor was it the Court\u2019s last chance to\nweigh in. The debate about habeas exclusivity remains on-\ngoing in the District Court, in the context of pending pre-\nliminary injunction proceedings. If the District Court were\nto resolve the question in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the Government\ncould have appealed to this Court in the ordinary course,\nand we could have decided it after thorough briefing and\noral argument. In its rush to decide the issue now, the\nCourt halts the lower court\u2019s work and forces us to decide\nthe matter after mere days of deliberation and without ad-\nequate time to weigh the parties\u2019 arguments or the full rec-\nord of the District Court\u2019s proceedings.\n\f                  Cite as: 604 U.

Department of Education, 604 U. S., at\n___, (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2). Recall that the\ndispute has now narrowed into a debate about \u201cwhich pro-\ncedural vehicle is best situated for the Plaintiffs\u2019 injunctive\nand declaratory claims\u201d: individual habeas petitions filed in\ndistrict courts across the country or a class action filed in\nthe District of Columbia. 2025 WL 914682, *29 (Millett, J.,\nconcurring). The Government may well prefer to defend\nagainst \u201c300 or more individual habeas petitions\u201d than face\nthis class APA case in Washington, D. C. Ibid. That is es-\npecially so because the Government can transfer detainees\nto particular locations in an attempt to secure a more hos-\npitable judicial forum. But such a preference for defending\nagainst one form of litigation over the other is far from the\nkind of concrete and irreparable harm that requires this\nCourt to take the \u201c \u2018extraordinary\u2019 \u201d step of intervening at\nthis moment, while litigation in the lower courts remains\nongoing.

S., at ___ (JACKSON, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 8).\n   Meanwhile, funneling plaintiffs\u2019 claims into individual\nhabeas actions across the Nation risks exposing them to se-\nvere and irreparable harm. Rather than seeking to enjoin\nimplementation of the President\u2019s Proclamation against all\nVenezuelan nationals in immigration detention, detainees\nscattered across the country must each obtain counsel and\nfile habeas petitions on their own accord, all without know-\ning whether they will remain in detention where they were\narrested or be secretly transferred to an alternative loca-\ntion.

See supra, at 7\u20138. Anyone\nthe Government mistakenly deports in its piecemeal and\nrushed implementation of the challenged Proclamation will\nface the same grave risks. Cf.

The Government\u2019s resistance to facili-\ntating the return of individuals erroneously removed to\nCECOT only amplifies the specter that, even if this Court\nsomeday declares the President\u2019s Proclamation unlawful,\nscores of individual lives may be irretrievably lost.\n   More fundamentally, this Court exercises its equitable\ndiscretion to intervene without accounting for the Govern-\nment noncompliance that has permeated this litigation to\ndate.

From the start, the Government sought\nto avoid judicial review, \u201chustl[ing] people onto those\nplanes\u201d without notice or public Proclamation apparently\n\u201cin the hopes of evading an injunction or perhaps prevent-\ning them from requesting the habeas hearing to which the\nGovernment now acknowledges they are entitled.\u201d 2025\nWL 890401, *5. That the District Court is engaged in a sin-\ncere inquiry into whether the Government willfully violated\nits March 15, 2025, order to turn around the planes should\nbe reason enough to doubt that the Government appears\nbefore this Court with clean hands. That is all the more\ntrue because the Government has persistently stonewalled\nthe District Court\u2019s efforts to find out whether the Govern-\nment in fact flouted its express order. See Tr. 4\u20135 (Mar. 15,\n2025); Tr. 6\u20139 (Mar. 17, 2025).\n                        *     *     *\n   The Government\u2019s conduct in this litigation poses an ex-\ntraordinary threat to the rule of law.

I write\nseparately to question the majority\u2019s choice to intervene on\nthe eve of the District Court\u2019s preliminary-injunction hear-\ning without scheduling argument or receiving merits brief-\ning. This fly-by-night approach to the work of the Supreme\nCourt is not only misguided. It is also dangerous.\n  The President of the United States has invoked a centu-\nries-old wartime statute to whisk people away to a notori-\nously brutal, foreign-run prison. For lovers of liberty, this\nshould be quite concerning. Surely, the question whether\nsuch Government action is consistent with our Constitution\nand laws warrants considerable thought and attention from\nthe Judiciary. That was why the District Court issued a\ntemporary restraining order to prevent immediate harm to\nthe targeted individuals while the court considered the law-\nfulness of the Government\u2019s conduct. But this Court now\nsees fit to intervene, hastily dashing off a four-paragraph\nper curiam opinion discarding the District Court\u2019s order\nbased solely on a new legal pronouncement that, one might\nhave thought, would require significant deliberation.\n  When this Court decides complex and monumental is-\nsues, it typically allows the lower courts to address those\n\f2                      TRUMP v. J. G. G.\n\n                     JACKSON, J., dissenting\n\nmatters first; it then receives full briefing, hears oral argu-\nment, deliberates internally, and, finally, issues a reasoned\nopinion. Those standard processes may not always yield\ncorrect results. But when we deviate from them, the risk of\nerror always substantially increases. Today\u2019s rushed con-\nclusion\u2014that those challenging the Government\u2019s action\ncan only pursue their claims through habeas\u2014is Exhibit A.\n   I lament that the Court appears to have embarked on a\nnew era of procedural variability, and that it has done so in\nsuch a casual, inequitable, and, in my view, inappropriate\nmanner. See Department of Education v. California, 604\nU. S. ___ , ___ (2025) (JACKSON, J., dissenting) (slip op., at\n1\u20132). At least when the Court went off base in the past, it\nleft a record so posterity could see how it went wrong. See,\ne.g., Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944). With\nmore and more of our most significant rulings taking place\nin the shadows of our emergency docket, today\u2019s Court\nleaves less and less of a trace. But make no mistake: We\nare just as wrong now as we have been in the past, with\nsimilarly devastating consequences. It just seems we are\nnow less willing to face it.\n\f", "html": "", "html_lawbox": "", "html_columbia": "", "html_anon_2020": "", "xml_harvard": "", "html_with_citations": "<pre class=\"inline\">                  Cite as: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">604 U.

For lovers of liberty, this\nshould be quite concerning. Surely, the question whether\nsuch Government action is consistent with our Constitution\nand laws warrants considerable thought and attention from\nthe Judiciary. That was why the District Court issued a\ntemporary restraining order to prevent immediate harm to\nthe targeted individuals while the court considered the law-\nfulness of the Government\u2019s conduct.
